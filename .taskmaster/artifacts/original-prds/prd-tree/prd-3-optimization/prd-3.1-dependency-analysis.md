# PRD-3.1: Dependency Analysis System

## Objective
Build a comprehensive task dependency graph from all generated PRDs, detecting cycles and resource conflicts to create a validated execution foundation.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Dependency Graph Construction**
   - Parse all PRD files in `$TASKMASTER_DOCS` directory
   - Extract task dependencies from requirement sections
   - Create directed graph representation in JSON format
   - Include resource requirements for each task node

2. **Cycle Detection Algorithm**
   - Implement topological sorting to detect circular dependencies
   - Identify specific tasks involved in cycles
   - Provide detailed cycle path information
   - Suggest resolution strategies for detected cycles

3. **Resource Analysis**
   - Extract CPU, memory, and I/O requirements from PRDs
   - Identify resource conflicts between concurrent tasks
   - Calculate total resource consumption estimates
   - Validate against system capacity constraints

4. **Output Generation**
   - Generate `task-tree.json` with complete dependency mapping
   - Include metadata for each task (priority, estimated duration)
   - Provide resource allocation recommendations
   - Create visual dependency graph representation

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Analysis must complete within 3 minutes for 100+ tasks
- Dependency graph must be deterministic and reproducible
- Memory usage must remain under 1GB during analysis
- Output format must be compatible with optimization algorithms

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Successfully parses all generated PRD files
- [ ] Creates valid JSON dependency graph structure
- [ ] Detects and reports any circular dependencies
- [ ] Includes comprehensive resource requirement data
- [ ] Validates against system resource constraints
- [ ] Generates human-readable dependency visualization

## Implementation Command
```bash
cd "$TASKMASTER_HOME/optimization"

task-master analyze-dependencies \
    --input "$TASKMASTER_DOCS" \
    --output task-tree.json \
    --include-resources \
    --detect-cycles \
    --format json \
    --verbose
```

## Expected Output Structure
```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "prd-1-environment-setup",
      "title": "Environment Setup and Initialization",
      "dependencies": [],
      "resources": {
        "cpu": "low",
        "memory": "128MB",
        "disk": "10MB",
        "duration": "120s"
      },
      "priority": "high"
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "from": "prd-1-environment-setup",
      "to": "prd-2-recursive-generation",
      "type": "prerequisite"
    }
  ],
  "analysis": {
    "total_tasks": 45,
    "cycles_detected": 0,
    "critical_path_length": 12,
    "total_estimated_time": "2.5 hours"
  }
}
```
