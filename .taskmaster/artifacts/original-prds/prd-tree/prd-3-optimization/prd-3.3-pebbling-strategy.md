# PRD-3.3: Pebbling Strategy Generation

## Objective
Generate an optimal pebbling strategy using branching-program approach to minimize memory usage while maintaining task execution correctness and resource allocation timing.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Branching-Program Pebbling Algorithm**
   - Implement decision tree approach for resource allocation
   - Evaluate 2-3 allocation options per task node
   - Apply memory minimization as primary optimization criterion
   - Generate executable pebbling strategy with timing decisions

2. **Resource Allocation Optimization**
   - Determine optimal timing for resource acquisition and release
   - Minimize peak memory usage across entire execution
   - Handle resource contention between concurrent tasks
   - Optimize for minimal resource fragmentation

3. **Memory Usage Minimization**
   - Apply pebbling game theory to task dependency graph
   - Calculate minimum pebbles (memory units) required
   - Implement pebble reuse strategies where possible
   - Ensure memory bounds respect optimization constraints

4. **Strategy Output Generation**
   - Create `pebbling-strategy.json` with allocation timeline
   - Include resource acquisition/release decisions
   - Provide memory usage projections
   - Generate execution timing recommendations

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Pebbling analysis must complete within 5 minutes
- Strategy must minimize memory usage by 40% or more
- Algorithm must handle graphs with 100+ nodes efficiently
- Generated strategy must be deterministic and reproducible

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Pebbling strategy reduces peak memory usage significantly
- [ ] All task dependencies respected in allocation timing
- [ ] Resource contention resolved optimally
- [ ] Strategy output format compatible with catalytic planning
- [ ] Algorithm completes within performance constraints
- [ ] Memory minimization objectives achieved measurably

## Implementation Command
```bash
task-master pebble \
    --strategy branching-program \
    --input tree-optimized.json \
    --output pebbling-strategy.json \
    --minimize memory \
    --optimize-timing \
    --validate-strategy
```

## Pebbling Algorithm Design

### Decision Tree Structure
For each task node, evaluate allocation options:
1. **Immediate Allocation**: Acquire resources when dependencies complete
2. **Delayed Allocation**: Wait for optimal resource availability
3. **Conditional Allocation**: Allocate based on system resource state

### Memory Minimization Strategy
```bash
# Pebbling game rules for memory optimization:
# 1. Place pebble = allocate memory for task
# 2. Remove pebble = deallocate memory after task completion
# 3. Minimize simultaneous pebbles = minimize peak memory
# 4. Respect dependencies = pebbles for prerequisites before dependents
```
