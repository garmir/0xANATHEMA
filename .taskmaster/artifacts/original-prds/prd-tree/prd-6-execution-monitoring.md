# PRD-6: Execution Monitoring and System Management

## Objective
Implement real-time execution monitoring, checkpoint management, and autonomous system control to ensure reliable and recoverable task execution.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard**
   - Display current task execution status
   - Show progress bars and completion percentages
   - Monitor resource utilization (CPU, memory, I/O)
   - Track autonomy score and system health metrics
   - Provide visual dependency graph navigation

2. **Checkpoint Management System**
   - Create automatic checkpoints every 5 minutes
   - Save complete system state including:
     - Current task execution position
     - Resource allocation status
     - Intermediate computation results
     - Error states and recovery information
   - Enable resume from any valid checkpoint
   - Validate checkpoint integrity before use

3. **Autonomous Execution Control**
   - Execute task queue without human intervention
   - Handle errors through automated recovery
   - Manage resource allocation dynamically
   - Maintain execution within optimized bounds
   - Provide emergency stop and manual override

4. **Error Recovery and Resilience**
   - Detect and classify execution errors
   - Implement retry logic for transient failures
   - Rollback to previous checkpoint on critical failures
   - Log all errors with detailed context
   - Notify monitoring systems of persistent issues

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Dashboard must update within 1 second of status changes
- Checkpoint creation must not interrupt task execution
- Resume capability must recover within 30 seconds
- Error detection must be real-time (sub-second)
- System must handle 24/7 autonomous operation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dashboard displays accurate real-time status
- [ ] Checkpoints are created reliably every 5 minutes
- [ ] Resume functionality restores exact execution state
- [ ] Autonomous execution completes without intervention
- [ ] Error recovery handles all anticipated failure modes
- [ ] Performance metrics remain within optimized bounds
- [ ] All monitoring data is persisted for analysis

## Implementation Components

### Dashboard Initialization
```bash
task-master monitor-init \
    --queue "$TASKMASTER_HOME/task-queue.md" \
    --dashboard "$TASKMASTER_HOME/dashboard.html" \
    --update-interval 1s \
    --include-graphs
```

### Execution with Monitoring
```bash
task-master execute \
    --queue "$TASKMASTER_HOME/task-queue.md" \
    --monitor \
    --checkpoint-interval 5m \
    --resume-on-failure \
    --autonomous-mode \
    --log-level info
```

### Manual Recovery Operations
```bash
# Emergency checkpoint save
task-master checkpoint --save --force

# Resume from specific checkpoint
task-master resume \
    --from-checkpoint "$TASKMASTER_HOME/checkpoints/latest.json" \
    --validate

# System status check
task-master status \
    --detailed \
    --include-resources \
    --format json
```

## Monitoring Features

### Dashboard Components
1. **Execution Overview**
   - Current task name and description
   - Overall progress percentage
   - Estimated time remaining
   - Tasks completed/remaining

2. **Resource Monitoring**
   - Memory usage vs. O(√n) bounds
   - CPU utilization trends
   - Disk I/O activity
   - Network connectivity status

3. **System Health**
   - Autonomy score maintenance
   - Error rate tracking
   - Recovery success rate
   - Performance degradation alerts

4. **Historical Analysis**
   - Execution timeline visualization
   - Resource usage patterns
   - Error frequency trends
   - Optimization effectiveness

### Checkpoint Content
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-10T10:30:00Z",
  "execution_state": {
    "current_task_id": "task-15",
    "completed_tasks": [...],
    "pending_tasks": [...],
    "resource_allocations": {...}
  },
  "system_metrics": {
    "memory_usage": "45% of O(√n)",
    "autonomy_score": 0.97,
    "execution_efficiency": 0.89
  },
  "error_log": [...],
  "recovery_information": {...}
}
```

## Dependencies

- Valid task queue and execution plan
- Web server capability for dashboard
- File system write permissions for checkpoints

## Success Metrics
- Dashboard loads and updates without errors
- 100% checkpoint creation success rate
- Resume capability tested successfully
- Autonomous execution runs for 8+ hours without intervention
- Error recovery rate > 95% for transient failures
- Performance remains within 5% of optimized baseline

## Monitoring Integrations
- System log aggregation and analysis
- Performance metric collection and trending
- Alert generation for critical threshold breaches
- Integration with external monitoring systems
- Automated report generation for execution analysis

## Risk Mitigation

- Include checksum validation for checkpoint integrity
- Provide manual intervention capabilities as backup
- Create detailed troubleshooting documentation
- Test recovery procedures under various failure scenarios
- Implement gradual degradation for non-critical monitoring failures

## Operational Procedures
1. **Daily Health Checks**: Verify system metrics and trends
2. **Weekly Analysis**: Review execution patterns and optimization opportunities
3. **Monthly Maintenance**: Archive old checkpoints and logs
4. **Emergency Procedures**: Manual override and recovery protocols
5. **Performance Tuning**: Adjust monitoring thresholds based on historical data
