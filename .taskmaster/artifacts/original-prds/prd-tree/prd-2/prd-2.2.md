# PRD-2.2: Fitness Evaluation Framework

## Overview
Implement comprehensive fitness evaluation system that measures execution plan quality across multiple dimensions including autonomy, efficiency, and resilience.

## Objectives
- Define quantitative metrics for autonomous execution capability
- Implement multi-objective fitness evaluation
- Create weighted scoring system for plan comparison
- Enable real-time fitness monitoring during evolution

## Requirements

### 1. Fitness Metrics
```typescript
interface FitnessMetrics {
  autonomyScore: number      // [0-1] Independent execution capability
  executionTime: number     // Milliseconds for plan completion
  memoryEfficiency: number  // [0-1] Resource utilization ratio
  errorResilience: number   // [0-1] Recovery capability
  resourceOptimization: number // [0-1] CPU/memory optimization
}

class FitnessEvaluator {
  async evaluateComprehensive(plan: ExecutionPlan): Promise<FitnessMetrics>
  async calculateAutonomyScore(plan: ExecutionPlan): Promise<number>
  async measureExecutionEfficiency(plan: ExecutionPlan): Promise<number>
  async assessErrorResilience(plan: ExecutionPlan): Promise<number>
}
```

### 2. Autonomy Score Calculation
- **Task Independence**: Can tasks execute without human intervention?
- **Dependency Resolution**: Are all dependencies automatically satisfied?
- **Error Recovery**: Does the system handle failures gracefully?
- **Resource Management**: Are resources allocated and deallocated properly?
- **State Persistence**: Can execution resume after interruption?

### 3. Multi-Objective Optimization
- Weighted sum approach with configurable weights
- Pareto optimality for non-dominated solutions
- Lexicographic ordering for priority-based evaluation
- Adaptive weight adjustment based on evolution progress

### 4. Performance Profiling
- Execution time measurement with high precision
- Memory usage tracking throughout execution
- CPU utilization monitoring
- I/O operation counting and analysis

## Success Criteria
- Autonomy score accurately reflects independent execution capability
- Fitness evaluation completes within 5% of execution time
- Multi-objective scoring enables effective plan comparison
- Fitness metrics demonstrate correlation with actual performance

## Dependencies
- PRD-2.1 (Genetic Algorithm Implementation)
- Execution plan simulator
- Performance monitoring tools
- Statistical analysis libraries
