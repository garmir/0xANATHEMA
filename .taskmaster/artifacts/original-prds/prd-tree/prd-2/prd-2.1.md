# PRD-2.1: Genetic Algorithm Implementation

## Overview
Implement core genetic algorithm components including mutation, crossover, selection, and population management for evolving execution plans toward autonomous capability.

## Objectives
- Create robust genetic operators for execution plan modification
- Implement population-based evolution with diversity maintenance
- Develop adaptive parameter tuning for optimization effectiveness
- Ensure convergence to high-quality solutions

## Requirements

### 1. Genetic Operators
```typescript
class GeneticOperators {
  async mutate(
    plan: ExecutionPlan, 
    mutationRate: number = 0.1
  ): Promise<ExecutionPlan>
  
  async crossover(
    parent1: ExecutionPlan, 
    parent2: ExecutionPlan,
    crossoverRate: number = 0.7
  ): Promise<[ExecutionPlan, ExecutionPlan]>
  
  async select(
    population: ExecutionPlan[],
    fitnessScores: number[]
  ): Promise<ExecutionPlan[]>
}
```

### 2. Mutation Strategies
- **Parameter Mutation**: Modify execution parameters (timing, resources)
- **Structure Mutation**: Alter task execution order within constraints
- **Strategy Mutation**: Change optimization approaches
- **Resource Mutation**: Adjust memory and CPU allocation

### 3. Crossover Methods
- **Uniform Crossover**: Random gene exchange between parents
- **Multi-point Crossover**: Structured segment exchange
- **Semantic Crossover**: Meaning-preserving plan combination
- **Adaptive Crossover**: Context-aware operator selection

### 4. Selection Mechanisms
- **Tournament Selection**: Competition-based selection
- **Roulette Wheel**: Fitness-proportionate selection
- **Rank-based Selection**: Ranking-based probability
- **Elitist Selection**: Best individual preservation

## Success Criteria
- Genetic operators maintain plan validity and executability
- Population diversity preserved throughout evolution
- Convergence rate optimized for 20-iteration limit
- Fitness improvement demonstrated across generations

## Dependencies
- PRD-2 (Evolutionary Optimization System)
- Execution plan validation
- Fitness evaluation framework
- Random number generation
