# Root PRD: Advanced Autonomous Task Management Ecosystem

## Executive Summary

This root PRD defines a comprehensive autonomous task management ecosystem that extends beyond simple task execution to create a self-evolving, intelligent system capable of recursive improvement, cross-domain knowledge transfer, and autonomous decision-making at enterprise scale.

## 1. System Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Core Components
- **Autonomous Task Engine**: Self-managing task execution with learning capabilities
- **Knowledge Graph Network**: Dynamic relationship mapping between tasks, domains, and outcomes
- **Predictive Planning Module**: AI-driven forecasting and resource optimization
- **Cross-Domain Transfer System**: Knowledge sharing across different project domains
- **Real-time Adaptation Engine**: Continuous system improvement based on execution feedback

### 1.2 Integration Points
- Multi-cloud deployment infrastructure
- Enterprise system APIs (JIRA, Azure DevOps, GitHub, etc.)
- AI/ML platform integrations (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
- Database systems (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis)
- Monitoring and observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK)
