# PRD-4: Evolutionary Optimization Loop

## Objective
Implement an evolutionary algorithm system that iteratively improves task execution plans until autonomous execution capability is achieved with a convergence threshold of 0.95.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Optimization Loop Implementation**
   - Maximum 20 iterations for convergence
   - Convergence threshold of 0.95 autonomy score
   - Iteration tracking and progress monitoring
   - Early termination on convergence achievement

2. **Execution Plan Evolution**
   - Generate initial execution plan from catalytic execution
   - Apply evolutionary improvements each iteration
   - Use exponential-evolutionary theory for enhancement
   - Maintain plan validity throughout evolution

3. **Performance Evaluation System**
   - Evaluate plans across three metrics: time, space, autonomy
   - Generate quantitative scores for each iteration
   - Track improvement trends and convergence patterns
   - Output structured metrics in JSON format

4. **Evolutionary Operators**
   - Mutation rate: 0.1 (10% chance of random changes)
   - Crossover rate: 0.7 (70% chance of combining solutions)
   - Selection pressure toward higher autonomy scores
   - Maintain genetic diversity in solution population

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Each iteration must complete within 3 minutes
- Convergence detection must be reliable and accurate
- Evolutionary operators must preserve solution validity
- Progress must be persistently tracked for recovery

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Optimization loop executes up to 20 iterations
- [ ] Autonomy score calculation is accurate and consistent
- [ ] Convergence threshold (0.95) correctly triggers termination
- [ ] Final execution plan achieves autonomous capability
- [ ] All iteration metrics are properly logged
- [ ] Evolutionary improvements show measurable progress
- [ ] Final plan validates against all constraints

## Implementation Components

### Core Function: optimize_to_autonomous()
```bash
optimize_to_autonomous() {
    local max_iterations=20
    local convergence_threshold=0.95
    
    for iteration in $(seq 1 $max_iterations); do
        # Generate execution plan
        task-master generate-execution
        
        # Evaluate efficiency metrics
        task-master evaluate --metrics time,space,autonomy
        
        # Check convergence
        if autonomy_score >= convergence_threshold; then
            # Success: autonomous capability achieved
            break
        fi
        
        # Apply evolutionary improvements
        task-master evolve \
            --theory exponential-evolutionary \
            --mutation-rate 0.1 \
            --crossover-rate 0.7
    done
}
```

### Evaluation Metrics
1. **Time Efficiency**: Execution duration optimization
2. **Space Efficiency**: Memory usage minimization  
3. **Autonomy Score**: Human intervention requirement reduction

### Evolutionary Theory Application
- **Exponential-Evolutionary Theory**: Accelerating improvement rates
- **Genetic Algorithm Principles**: Mutation, crossover, selection
- **Population-Based Search**: Multiple solution candidates
- **Fitness-Proportionate Selection**: Better solutions more likely to survive

## Dependencies
- PRD-3: Computational Optimization (completed)
- Catalytic execution plan generated
- task-master CLI with evolution capabilities
- JSON processing utilities (jq or equivalent)

## Success Metrics
- Achieves 0.95+ autonomy score within 20 iterations
- Shows monotonic improvement in autonomy metrics
- Reduces execution time by 25% or more
- Maintains memory efficiency within optimized bounds
- Generates valid, executable final plan
- Completes optimization within 1 hour total time

## Evolutionary Parameters
- **Population Size**: Derived from task complexity
- **Mutation Strategy**: Random parameter adjustment
- **Crossover Strategy**: Uniform crossover of execution steps
- **Selection Method**: Tournament selection with elitism
- **Fitness Function**: Weighted combination of time, space, autonomy

## Risk Mitigation
- Implement solution validation after each evolutionary step
- Maintain backup of best solution found so far
- Include timeout mechanisms for individual iterations
- Provide fallback to previous iteration if evolution fails
- Monitor convergence stagnation and apply restart strategies
- Ensure genetic diversity maintenance throughout evolution
