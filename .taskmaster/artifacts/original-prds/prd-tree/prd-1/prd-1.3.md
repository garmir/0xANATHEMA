# PRD-1.3: Optimization Engine Implementation

## Overview
Implement the Optimization Engine that applies advanced computational algorithms to minimize space and time complexity of task execution.

## Objectives
- Implement square-root space simulation (Williams 2025)
- Apply tree evaluation optimization (Cook & Mertz)
- Generate optimal pebbling strategies
- Enable catalytic computing with memory reuse

## Requirements

### 1. Space Optimization Algorithms
```typescript
class OptimizationEngine {
  async applySqrtSpaceOptimization(
    taskGraph: TaskGraph
  ): Promise<OptimizedGraph>
  
  async applyTreeEvalOptimization(
    graph: OptimizedGraph
  ): Promise<TreeOptimizedGraph>
  
  async generatePebblingStrategy(
    graph: TaskGraph
  ): Promise<PebblingStrategy>
}
```

### 2. Algorithm Implementations
- **Square-root space simulation**: Reduce memory from O(n) to O(√n)
- **Tree evaluation**: Achieve O(log n · log log n) space complexity
- **Pebbling strategies**: Minimize peak memory usage
- **Catalytic computing**: Enable memory reuse without data loss

### 3. Optimization Pipeline
- Sequential optimization stages with validation
- Algorithm chaining with intermediate verification
- Performance metrics collection at each stage
- Rollback capability for failed optimizations

### 4. Resource Management
- Memory allocation tracking
- CPU usage optimization
- I/O operation minimization
- Disk space management for spilling

## Success Criteria
