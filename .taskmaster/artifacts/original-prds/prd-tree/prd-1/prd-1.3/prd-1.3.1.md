# PRD-1.3.1: Square-Root Space Optimization Algorithm

## Overview
Implement the Williams 2025 square-root space simulation algorithm to reduce memory complexity from O(n) to O(√n) while maintaining execution correctness.

## Objectives
- Implement space-efficient task graph traversal
- Reduce memory footprint through chunked processing
- Maintain execution ordering and dependencies
- Provide measurable memory reduction

## Requirements

### 1. Algorithm Implementation
```typescript
class SqrtSpaceOptimizer {
  async optimize(taskGraph: TaskGraph): Promise<SqrtOptimizedGraph> {
    const chunkSize = Math.ceil(Math.sqrt(taskGraph.size))
    const chunks = this.createChunks(taskGraph, chunkSize)
    return this.processChunks(chunks)
  }
  
  private createChunks(graph: TaskGraph, size: number): TaskChunk[]
  private processChunks(chunks: TaskChunk[]): Promise<SqrtOptimizedGraph>
  private validateChunkBoundaries(chunks: TaskChunk[]): boolean
}
```

### 2. Memory Management
- Chunk-based processing with √n memory bound
- Spill-to-disk mechanism for large intermediate results
- Garbage collection optimization between chunks
- Memory usage monitoring and enforcement

### 3. Dependency Preservation
- Cross-chunk dependency tracking
- Deferred execution for dependent tasks
- Intermediate result caching strategies
- Correctness validation after optimization

### 4. Performance Metrics
- Memory usage reduction measurement
- Execution time impact analysis
- Cache hit/miss ratio tracking
- Spill operation frequency monitoring

## Success Criteria
- Reduces memory usage to O(√n) bounds
- Maintains 100% execution correctness
- Achieves >60% memory reduction on large task graphs
- Completes optimization within 2x original execution time

## Dependencies
- Task graph data structures
- Memory profiling utilities
- Disk I/O management
- Mathematical square root calculations
