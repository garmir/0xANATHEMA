# PRD-1.1: Task Engine Implementation

## Overview
Implement the central Task Engine that coordinates all task processing, manages the execution lifecycle, and provides the primary interface for system operations.

## Objectives
- Create robust task lifecycle management (pending → in-progress → done)
- Implement concurrent task execution with dependency resolution
- Provide comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Enable real-time monitoring and progress tracking

## Requirements

### 1. Task Lifecycle Management
```typescript
class TaskEngine {
  async initialize(config: SystemConfig): Promise<void>
  async loadTaskTree(source: string): Promise<TaskTree>
  async validateDependencies(tree: TaskTree): Promise<ValidationResult>
  async executeTaskGraph(graph: TaskGraph): Promise<ExecutionResult>
}
```

### 2. Dependency Resolution
- Topological sorting for execution order
- Cycle detection and resolution
- Dynamic dependency injection
- Resource conflict resolution

### 3. Concurrent Execution
- Worker pool for parallel task execution
- Resource-aware scheduling
- Memory-bounded execution queues
- Backpressure handling

### 4. Error Handling
- Task-level error isolation
- Automatic retry mechanisms
- Graceful degradation strategies
- Recovery from partial failures

## Success Criteria
- Handles task graphs with up to 1000 nodes
- Executes independent tasks in parallel
- Recovers from individual task failures
- Maintains execution state across restarts

## Dependencies
- PRD-1 (Core System Architecture)
- Task definition schemas
- Dependency validation algorithms
