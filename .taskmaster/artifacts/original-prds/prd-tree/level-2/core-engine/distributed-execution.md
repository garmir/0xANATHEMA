# PRD Level 2: Distributed Task Execution Engine

## Overview
High-performance, fault-tolerant distributed execution engine capable of processing thousands of tasks across multiple compute nodes.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Node Management Layer
**Purpose**: Manage cluster of execution nodes with automatic discovery and health monitoring
**Implementation Details**:
- Kubernetes-native node registration
- Health check probes (liveness, readiness, startup)
- Automatic node scaling based on workload
- Resource capacity reporting and allocation

### 2. Task Distribution Algorithm
**Purpose**: Intelligently distribute tasks across available nodes for optimal performance
**Algorithm Specifications**:
- Consistent hashing for task-to-node mapping
- Load balancing with weighted round-robin
- Affinity rules for data locality optimization
- Anti-affinity rules for fault tolerance

### 3. Execution Context Management
**Purpose**: Maintain isolated execution environments for concurrent task processing
**Technical Requirements**:
- Container-based isolation (Docker/Podman)
- Resource limits and quotas enforcement
- Network isolation and security policies
- Shared volume management for data access

### 4. Inter-Node Communication
**Purpose**: Enable efficient communication and coordination between execution nodes
**Protocol Specifications**:
- gRPC for high-performance RPC calls
- Apache Kafka for asynchronous messaging
- Redis Cluster for distributed caching
- etcd for configuration synchronization

## Performance Specifications
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Support 100+ execution nodes
- **Task Throughput**: 10,000+ concurrent task executions
- **Fault Recovery**: <30 seconds automatic failover
- **Resource Efficiency**: 95% CPU and memory utilization

## Implementation Tasks
1. Design and implement node discovery protocol
2. Develop task distribution algorithms
3. Create container orchestration layer
4. Build inter-node communication framework
5. Implement monitoring and health checking
6. Create fault tolerance and recovery mechanisms

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for node communication
- Load tests with 1000+ concurrent tasks
- Chaos engineering for fault tolerance validation

## Dependencies
- Kubernetes cluster infrastructure
- Container runtime environment
- Message queue system (Kafka)
- Distributed cache (Redis Cluster)
