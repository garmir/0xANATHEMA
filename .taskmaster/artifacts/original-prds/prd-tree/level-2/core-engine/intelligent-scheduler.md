# PRD Level 2: Intelligent Task Scheduler

## Overview
AI-powered scheduling system that optimizes task execution order using machine learning algorithms and real-time system metrics.

## Scheduling Algorithms

### 1. Multi-Objective Optimization Scheduler
**Purpose**: Balance multiple competing objectives (time, resources, energy, cost)
**Algorithm Design**:
- Pareto frontier optimization for trade-off analysis
- Weighted scoring system for priority calculation
- Dynamic weight adjustment based on system state
- Constraint satisfaction with soft and hard limits

### 2. Machine Learning Prediction Engine
**Purpose**: Learn from historical execution patterns to improve scheduling decisions
**ML Model Architecture**:
- LSTM networks for time-series prediction
- Random Forest for resource requirement estimation
- Reinforcement learning for policy optimization
- Ensemble methods for robust predictions

### 3. Real-time Adaptive Scheduling
**Purpose**: Continuously adjust schedules based on changing system conditions
**Adaptation Mechanisms**:
- Event-driven rescheduling triggers
- Sliding window performance analysis
- Predictive congestion avoidance
- Emergency priority escalation protocols

### 4. Dependency-Aware Scheduling
**Purpose**: Respect task dependencies while maximizing parallelism
**Dependency Handling**:
- Topological sorting for execution order
- Critical path analysis for timeline optimization
- Dependency relaxation for performance gains
- Circular dependency detection and resolution

## Performance Metrics
- **Scheduling Latency**: <10ms for schedule generation
- **Throughput Optimization**: 40% improvement over FIFO
- **Resource Utilization**: 90% average across all nodes
- **Deadline Adherence**: 98% on-time completion rate

## Implementation Components
1. **Priority Queue Manager**: Multi-level priority queues with aging
2. **Resource Predictor**: ML models for resource requirement forecasting
3. **Conflict Resolver**: Algorithm for handling resource contention
