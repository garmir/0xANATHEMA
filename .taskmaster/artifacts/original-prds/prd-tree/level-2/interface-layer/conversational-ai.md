# PRD Level 2: Conversational AI Interface

## Overview
Natural language interface that allows users to interact with the Task Master system through voice and text, making task management as simple as having a conversation.

## AI Components

### 1. Natural Language Understanding (NLU)
**Purpose**: Parse and understand user intents from natural language input
**Capabilities**:
- Intent classification (create_task, update_status, get_progress, etc.)
- Entity extraction (dates, priorities, assignees, dependencies)
- Context tracking across multi-turn conversations
- Ambiguity resolution through clarifying questions

### 2. Dialog Management System
**Purpose**: Maintain conversation state and guide users through complex interactions
**Features**:
- Multi-turn conversation handling
- Context preservation across sessions
- Proactive suggestions and recommendations
- Conversation memory and personalization

### 3. Natural Language Generation (NLG)
**Purpose**: Generate human-like responses and explanations
**Generation Types**:
- Status updates and progress reports
- Task recommendations and suggestions
- Error explanations and troubleshooting help
- System capability descriptions

### 4. Voice Interface Integration
**Purpose**: Support voice-based interaction for hands-free operation
**Voice Features**:
- Speech-to-text with noise reduction
- Text-to-speech with natural voices
- Wake word detection for always-on mode
- Voice biometric authentication

## Conversation Flows

### 1. Task Creation Conversation
```
User: "I need to create a project for the new marketing campaign"
AI: "I'd be happy to help you create that project. What's the deadline for the marketing campaign?"
User: "We need it done by end of March"
AI: "Great! I'll set the deadline for March 31st. What are the main components of this campaign?"
User: "We need design assets, copy writing, and social media content"
AI: "Perfect! I'll create a project with three main tasks: design assets, copywriting, and social media content, all due March 31st. Would you like me to assign these to specific team members?"
```

### 2. Status Inquiry Conversation
```
User: "How is the website redesign project going?"
AI: "The website redesign project is 65% complete. The design phase is finished, development is 80% done, and testing will start next week. We're on track to meet the December 15th deadline."
User: "Any blockers?"
AI: "Yes, there's one blocker: the client feedback on the homepage design is overdue by 3 days. Should I send a reminder?"
```

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Language Model Integration
**LLM Selection**:
- GPT-4/Claude for complex reasoning tasks
- Specialized task management models for domain-specific understanding
- Local models for privacy-sensitive deployments
- Hybrid approach with model routing based on query complexity

### 2. Intent Classification Pipeline
**ML Pipeline**:
- BERT-based intent classifier for high accuracy
- Few-shot learning for new intent types
- Active learning for continuous improvement
- Confidence scoring and fallback mechanisms

### 3. Context Management
**Context Storage**:
- Redis for session-based context storage
- Graph databases for relationship tracking
- Vector databases for semantic similarity
- Long-term memory in relational databases

### 4. Multi-modal Integration
**Input Channels**:
- Web chat interface with rich messaging
- Mobile app voice integration
- Slack/Teams bot integration
- Phone system integration for voice calls

## Performance Requirements
- **Response Time**: <2 seconds for text, <3 seconds for voice
- **Accuracy**: 95% intent classification accuracy
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime for chat interface
- **Language Support**: English, Spanish, French, German, Japanese

## Implementation Tasks
1. Design conversation flows and dialog trees
2. Train/fine-tune NLU models for task management domain
3. Implement dialog management system
4. Integrate voice processing capabilities
5. Build multi-channel interface adapters
6. Create conversation analytics and improvement pipeline

## User Experience Goals
- Natural conversation flow without rigid commands
- Proactive assistance and smart suggestions
- Graceful error handling with helpful guidance
- Consistent personality and tone across interactions

## Dependencies
- Access to large language models (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Speech processing services (Google, Azure, AWS)
- Real-time messaging infrastructure
- User authentication and authorization system
