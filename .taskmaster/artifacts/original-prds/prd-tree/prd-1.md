# PRD-1: Task-Master Core System Architecture

## Overview
Define the foundational architecture for the task-master recursive generation system, establishing core components, interfaces, and execution patterns for autonomous task decomposition and optimization.

## Objectives
- Establish modular system architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Define interfaces between recursive decomposition, optimization, and execution components
- Implement robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Create extensible framework for additional optimization algorithms

## Requirements

### 1. Core System Components
- **Task Engine**: Central task processing and execution coordinator
- **Decomposition Engine**: Recursive PRD breakdown with depth tracking
- **Optimization Engine**: Space/time complexity optimization pipeline
- **Execution Engine**: Autonomous task execution with monitoring
- **State Manager**: Persistent state handling with checkpoint/resume

### 2. System Interfaces
```typescript
interface TaskEngine {
  initialize(config: SystemConfig): Promise<void>
  processTaskTree(tree: TaskTree): Promise<ExecutionPlan>
  executeWithMonitoring(plan: ExecutionPlan): Promise<ExecutionResult>
}

interface DecompositionEngine {
  recursiveDecompose(prd: PRD, depth: number): Promise<TaskHierarchy>
  validateAtomicity(task: Task): boolean
  generateSubTasks(parentTask: Task): Promise<Task[]>
}

interface OptimizationEngine {
  applySpaceOptimization(tasks: Task[]): Promise<OptimizedTasks>
  generatePebblingStrategy(taskGraph: TaskGraph): Promise<PebblingPlan>
  optimizeCatalyticExecution(plan: ExecutionPlan): Promise<CatalyticPlan>
}
```

### 3. Architecture Patterns
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Async task processing with event notifications
- **Pipeline Pattern**: Sequential optimization stages with validation
- **Strategy Pattern**: Pluggable optimization algorithms
- **Observer Pattern**: Real-time monitoring and progress tracking

## Success Criteria
- Modular components can be developed and tested independently
- System handles recursive decomposition to arbitrary depth
- All interfaces support async/await patterns for scalability
- Error boundaries prevent cascading failures
- Memory usage remains within O(âˆšn) bounds during execution

## Dependencies
- Node.js runtime environment
- TypeScript for type safety
- Event emitter system for async coordination
- Persistent storage for state management

## Implementation Priority
High - This is the foundational architecture that all other components depend on.
