# PRD-2: Evolutionary Optimization System

## Overview
Implement an evolutionary optimization system that iteratively improves task execution plans using genetic algorithms and exponential-evolutionary theory to achieve autonomous execution capability.

## Objectives
- Develop evolutionary algorithms for execution plan optimization
- Implement fitness evaluation for autonomy scoring
- Create mutation and crossover operators for plan improvement
- Achieve convergence to autonomous execution (≥0.95 autonomy score)

## Requirements

### 1. Evolutionary Framework
```typescript
class EvolutionaryOptimizer {
  async evolveToAutonomous(
    initialPlan: ExecutionPlan,
    maxIterations: number = 20,
    convergenceThreshold: number = 0.95
  ): Promise<AutonomousExecutionPlan>
  
  async evaluateFitness(plan: ExecutionPlan): Promise<FitnessMetrics>
  async applyMutation(plan: ExecutionPlan, rate: number): Promise<ExecutionPlan>
  async performCrossover(parent1: ExecutionPlan, parent2: ExecutionPlan): Promise<ExecutionPlan>
}
```

### 2. Fitness Evaluation
- **Autonomy Score**: Measure of independent execution capability
- **Execution Efficiency**: Time and resource utilization metrics
- **Error Resilience**: Recovery from failures without intervention
- **Resource Optimization**: Memory and CPU usage efficiency

### 3. Genetic Operators
- **Mutation**: Random modifications to execution parameters
- **Crossover**: Combination of successful execution strategies
- **Selection**: Tournament selection based on fitness scores
- **Elitism**: Preservation of best-performing plans

### 4. Convergence Monitoring
- Fitness trajectory tracking across generations
- Early termination for premature convergence
- Diversity maintenance in population
- Plateau detection and diversity injection

## Success Criteria
- Achieves ≥0.95 autonomy score within 20 iterations
- Demonstrates measurable improvement across generations
- Produces stable, reproducible execution plans
- Maintains execution correctness throughout evolution

## Dependencies
- Task execution engine
- Performance measurement tools
