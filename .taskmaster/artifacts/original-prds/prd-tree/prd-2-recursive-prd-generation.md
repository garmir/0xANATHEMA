# PRD-2: Recursive PRD Generation System

## Objective
Implement a recursive PRD decomposition system that breaks down project plans into atomic tasks through iterative analysis and generation.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **First-Level PRD Generation**
   - Generate initial PRDs from project plan using task-master research
   - Output to structured directory pattern: `$TASKMASTER_DOCS/prd-{n}.md`
   - Include comprehensive logging at info level

2. **Recursive Decomposition Function**
   - Implement `process_prd_recursive()` with depth tracking
   - Maximum recursion depth of 5 levels
   - Automatic subdirectory creation for each decomposition level
   - Atomic task detection and processing termination

3. **Directory Structure Management**
   - Hierarchical organization: `prd-1/prd-1.1/prd-1.1.1/`
   - Preserve parent-child relationships in file naming
   - Maintain consistent depth tracking across all branches

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Recursion must be bounded to prevent infinite loops
- Each decomposition level must complete within 2 minutes
- Memory usage must remain within O(√n) bounds
- Support concurrent processing of multiple PRD branches

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Initial PRD generation produces structured output files
- [ ] Recursive function correctly tracks and limits depth
- [ ] Atomic task detection prevents unnecessary decomposition
- [ ] Directory structure matches expected hierarchy
- [ ] All generated PRDs are valid markdown format
- [ ] Process completes within depth and time limits

## Implementation Components

### Core Functions
1. **process_prd_recursive(input_prd, output_dir, depth)**
   - Depth boundary checking
   - Subdirectory creation
   - Atomic task validation
   - Recursive call management

2. **atomic_check_function()**
   - Single responsibility verification
   - Measurable outcome detection
   - Complexity analysis for further decomposition

```

## Dependencies
- PRD-1: Environment Setup (completed)
- task-master CLI with research functionality
- Sufficient disk space for hierarchical structure
- Bash shell with function definition support

## Success Metrics
- Generates 15-25 atomic PRDs from initial project plan
- Achieves 4-5 levels of decomposition depth
- Zero infinite loops or stack overflow errors
- All generated PRDs pass markdown validation
- Directory structure navigable and logically organized

## Risk Mitigation
- Implement strict depth limits to prevent runaway recursion
- Add timeout mechanisms for individual decomposition operations
- Validate input PRDs before attempting decomposition
- Include rollback capability for failed decomposition attempts
