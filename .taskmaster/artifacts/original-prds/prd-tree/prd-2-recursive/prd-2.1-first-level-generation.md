# PRD-2.1: First-Level PRD Generation

## Objective
Generate the initial set of PRDs from the project plan using task-master research functionality with structured output patterns.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Input Processing**
   - Read project-plan.md as primary input source
   - Parse structured content for PRD generation targets
   - Identify major system components for decomposition
   - Extract requirements and success criteria

2. **Research Command Execution**
   - Execute task-master research with appropriate parameters
   - Use output pattern: `$TASKMASTER_DOCS/prd-{n}.md`
   - Set logging level to info for detailed tracking
   - Handle command execution errors gracefully

3. **Output Structure Validation**
   - Ensure generated PRDs follow consistent naming convention
   - Validate markdown format compliance
   - Verify each PRD contains required sections
   - Check for completeness and coherence

4. **Quality Assurance**
   - Review generated content for accuracy
   - Ensure PRDs map to project objectives
   - Validate technical feasibility
   - Confirm scope boundaries are appropriate

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Generation must complete within 2 minutes
- Produced PRDs must be human-readable
- File naming must be sequential and logical
- Output must be deterministic and reproducible

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 5-8 initial PRDs generated successfully
- [ ] All PRDs follow markdown format standards
- [ ] File naming follows prd-{n}.md pattern
- [ ] Each PRD contains objective, requirements, and criteria
- [ ] No duplicate or overlapping content across PRDs
- [ ] All files saved to correct directory location

## Implementation Command
```bash
task-master research \
    --input project-plan.md \
    --output-pattern "$TASKMASTER_DOCS/prd-{n}.md" \
    --log-level info \
    --max-prds 8 \
    --validate-output
```

## Expected Output PRDs
1. **prd-1.md**: Environment Setup and Initialization
2. **prd-2.md**: Recursive PRD Generation System  
3. **prd-3.md**: Computational Optimization Implementation
4. **prd-4.md**: Evolutionary Optimization Loop
5. **prd-5.md**: Final Validation and Task Queue Generation
6. **prd-6.md**: Execution Monitoring and System Management

## Dependencies
- PRD-1: Environment Setup (completed)
- project-plan.md file accessible and readable
- task-master CLI research functionality available
- $TASKMASTER_DOCS directory created and writable

## Success Metrics
- 100% successful PRD generation from input
- Zero format validation errors
- All generated files under 5KB size
- Content covers complete project scope
- No missing critical components

## Quality Validation
- Each PRD has clear objective statement
- Requirements are specific and measurable
- Acceptance criteria are testable
- Dependencies are clearly identified
- Implementation approach is feasible

## Error Handling
- Validate input file exists before processing
- Handle task-master command failures gracefully
- Implement retry logic for transient failures
- Log all errors with sufficient context for debugging
- Provide meaningful error messages for troubleshooting
