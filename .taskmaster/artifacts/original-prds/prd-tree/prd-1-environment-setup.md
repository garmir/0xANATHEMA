# PRD-1: Environment Setup and Initialization

## Objective
Initialize the Task-Master working environment with proper directory structure, environment variables, and logging configuration to support autonomous execution.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Create directory structure: `.taskmaster/{docs,optimization,catalytic,logs}`
2. Set environment variables:
   - `TASKMASTER_HOME`: Points to `.taskmaster` directory
   - `TASKMASTER_DOCS`: Points to docs subdirectory  
   - `TASKMASTER_LOGS`: Points to logs subdirectory
3. Configure execution logging with timestamped output
4. Verify macOS TouchID configuration
5. Validate task-master CLI installation

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Directory creation must be atomic
- Environment variables must persist for session
- Logging must capture both stdout and stderr
- Setup must complete in under 30 seconds

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All required directories exist
- [ ] Environment variables are properly set
- [ ] Logging is active and writing to timestamped files
- [ ] TouchID is configured and accessible
- [ ] task-master CLI responds to version check

## Implementation Notes
- Use current working directory as base
- Enable real-time log tailing capability
- Ensure permissions allow file creation
- Validate prerequisite system components

## Dependencies
- macOS operating system
- TouchID hardware capability
- task-master CLI pre-installed
- Bash shell environment

## Success Metrics
- Zero errors during directory creation
- All environment variables accessible via `echo`
- Log file created with current timestamp
- TouchID test succeeds
