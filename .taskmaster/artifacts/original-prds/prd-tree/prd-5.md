# PRD-5: Integration and Deployment System

## Overview
Implement integration framework and deployment system that orchestrates all components into a cohesive autonomous execution platform with CI/CD capabilities and production monitoring.

## Objectives
- Create seamless integration between all system components
- Implement automated testing and validation pipeline
- Develop deployment automation with rollback capabilities
- Enable production monitoring and performance tracking

## Requirements

### 1. Component Integration
```typescript
class SystemIntegrator {
  async initializeSystem(config: SystemConfig): Promise<TaskMasterSystem>
  async orchestrateComponents(): Promise<ComponentOrchestrator>
  async validateIntegration(): Promise<IntegrationReport>
  async performHealthCheck(): Promise<HealthStatus>
}

interface TaskMasterSystem {
  taskEngine: TaskEngine
  decompositionEngine: DecompositionEngine
  optimizationEngine: OptimizationEngine
  evolutionaryOptimizer: EvolutionaryOptimizer
  monitoringSystem: MonitoringSystem
  catalyticWorkspace: CatalyticWorkspace
}
```

### 2. Testing Pipeline
- **Unit Testing**: Individual component validation
- **Integration Testing**: Component interaction verification
- **End-to-End Testing**: Complete system workflow validation
- **Performance Testing**: Load and stress testing
- **Regression Testing**: Backward compatibility verification

### 3. Deployment Automation
- **Containerization**: Docker-based deployment packages
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Automated environment provisioning
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Zero-downtime deployment strategy
- **Rollback Mechanism**: Automatic rollback on deployment failures

### 4. Production Operations
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous system health assessment
- **Performance Metrics**: Real-time performance dashboard
- **Alerting System**: Automated alerts for critical issues
- **Log Aggregation**: Centralized logging and analysis

## Success Criteria
- All components integrate seamlessly with <1% failure rate
- Automated testing achieves >95% code coverage
- Deployment completes within 15 minutes with zero downtime
- Production monitoring provides <5 second alert response time

## Dependencies
- All previous PRD components
- CI/CD infrastructure
- Container orchestration platform
- Monitoring and alerting tools

## Implementation Priority
Medium - Required for production deployment and operations
