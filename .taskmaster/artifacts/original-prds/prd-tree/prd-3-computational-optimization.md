## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

   - Build complete task dependency graph from all generated PRDs
   - Detect circular dependencies and resolve conflicts
   - Include resource requirements and constraints
   - Output structured JSON representation

2. **Space-Efficient Optimization**
   - Apply square-root space simulation (Williams, 2025)
   - Implement tree evaluation optimization (Cook & Mertz)
   - Reduce memory complexity from O(n) to O(√n)
   - Achieve O(log n * log log n) space complexity for evaluation

3. **Pebbling Strategy Generation**
   - Implement branching-program pebbling approach
   - Optimize resource allocation timing
   - Minimize memory usage while maintaining correctness
   - Generate executable pebbling strategy

4. **Catalytic Execution Planning**
   - Initialize 10GB catalytic workspace
   - Implement memory reuse factor of 0.8
   - Generate catalytic execution plan
   - Ensure data integrity without loss

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Optimization algorithms must complete within 10 minutes
- Memory usage must not exceed system limits
- All optimizations must preserve task correctness
- Intermediate results must be persisted for recovery

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Dependency graph correctly represents all task relationships
- [ ] No circular dependencies detected in final graph
- [ ] Space complexity reduced to target bounds
- [ ] Pebbling strategy minimizes resource contention
- [ ] Catalytic workspace initializes with correct capacity
- [ ] Memory reuse factor achieves 0.8 or better
- [ ] All optimization outputs are valid JSON/executable format

## Implementation Components

### Phase 3.1: Dependency Analysis
```bash
task-master analyze-dependencies \
    --input "$TASKMASTER_DOCS" \
    --output task-tree.json \
    --include-resources \
    --detect-cycles
```

### Phase 3.2: Space Optimization
```bash
# Square-root space simulation
task-master optimize \
    --algorithm sqrt-space \
    --memory-bound "sqrt(n)"

# Tree evaluation optimization  
task-master optimize \
    --algorithm tree-eval \
    --space-complexity "O(log n * log log n)"
```

### Phase 3.3: Resource Strategy
```bash
# Pebbling strategy generation
task-master pebble \
    --strategy branching-program \
    --minimize memory

# Catalytic planning
task-master catalytic-plan \
    --reuse-factor 0.8
```

## Dependencies
- PRD-2: Recursive PRD Generation (completed)
- All atomic PRDs generated and validated
- task-master CLI with optimization modules
- Sufficient disk space for intermediate files

## Success Metrics
- Task dependency graph contains 100+ nodes
- Zero circular dependencies in final analysis
- Memory usage reduced by 60% or more through optimization
- Pebbling strategy achieves optimal resource timing
- Catalytic workspace utilization efficiency > 75%
- All optimization phases complete without errors

## Theory Implementation
1. **Williams Square-Root Space**: Memory bound = √(task_count)
2. **Cook & Mertz Tree Evaluation**: Space = O(log n * log log n)
3. **Branching-Program Pebbling**: Minimize peak memory usage
4. **Catalytic Computing**: Enable memory reuse without data loss

## Risk Mitigation
- Validate input task graph before optimization
- Implement checkpointing for long-running optimizations
- Include fallback algorithms for edge cases
- Monitor memory usage during optimization phases
- Provide recovery mechanisms for failed optimizations
