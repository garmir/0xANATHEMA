# PRD: Core Features

## 3. Core Features

### 3.1 Session Management Layer
**Session ID Generator**
- Generate unique session IDs using format: `{norse_name}_{timestamp}_{random_hash}`
- Utilize CSPRNG (Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generator)
- Implement nanosecond-precision timestamps
- Include collision detection with automatic retry logic
- Maintain comprehensive Norse mythology name database (100+ names)

**Session Directory Structure**
- Create isolated session directories: `~/.sessions/{session_id}/`
- Implement strict permission management (700 for directories, 600 for files)
- Generate standardized subdirectories: `config.json`, `logs/`, `data/`, `temp/`
- Provide secure cleanup procedures with configurable retention policies
- Integrate SQLite database for session state persistence and metadata tracking

### 3.2 Configuration Management System
**JSON-Based Configuration**
- Design comprehensive config.json schema with validation
- Support environment variable overrides and interpolation
- Implement configuration versioning and migration support
- Provide template generation for common use cases
- Include robust error handling for malformed configurations

**Environment Integration**
- Seamless integration with shell environment variables
- Support for multiple configuration profiles (dev, staging, prod)
- Dynamic configuration reloading without session restart
- Secure storage of sensitive configuration data

### 3.3 AI Integration Layer
**claude-flow Integration**
- Implement comprehensive API client with authentication
- Create workflow orchestration engine with task execution pipeline
- Develop result validation and processing mechanisms
- Include error handling with exponential backoff retry logic
- Support for workflow templates and custom orchestration patterns

**Perplexity AI Integration**
- Build external validation API client with rate limiting
- Implement response parsing and data extraction capabilities
- Create circuit breaker pattern for service resilience
- Support for multiple AI model endpoints and fallback mechanisms
- Include caching layer for repeated queries

### 3.4 Security Framework
**API Key Management**
- Secure storage and retrieval of API keys from environment
- Support for key rotation and expiration handling
- Implement access control and audit logging for key usage
- Provide encrypted storage options for sensitive credentials

**Data Protection**
- Input sanitization and validation for all user inputs
- Secure file handling with proper permission management
- Encryption for sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Comprehensive audit logging for all system operations

### 3.5 Testing Infrastructure
**Comprehensive Test Suite**
- Unit tests for all core components using BATS-core framework
- Integration tests for AI service interactions and workflow execution
- Performance tests for session creation and directory management
- Security tests for input validation and access control
- Cross-platform compatibility tests (Linux, macOS, WSL2)

**Quality Assurance**
- Achieve 95%+ test coverage across all components
- Implement continuous integration with automated testing
- Include load testing for concurrent session creation
- Establish performance benchmarks and regression testing
