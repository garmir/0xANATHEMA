# PRD: Risk Assessment

## 7. Risk Assessment

### 7.1 Technical Risks
**High Risk**: AI service dependencies could cause system failures
- Mitigation: Implement circuit breaker pattern and offline fallback modes

**Medium Risk**: Session ID collision despite collision detection
- Mitigation: Use CSPRNG with sufficient entropy and comprehensive testing

**Low Risk**: Cross-platform compatibility issues
- Mitigation: Extensive testing on all target platforms and POSIX compliance

### 7.2 Operational Risks
**High Risk**: API key exposure or unauthorized access
- Mitigation: Secure key management, encryption, and comprehensive audit logging

**Medium Risk**: Performance degradation under high load
- Mitigation: Load testing, performance monitoring, and resource optimization
