# PRD Generation Strategy for Task-Master Recursive System

Based on the project context, I'll outline a comprehensive approach to generate individual PRD documents from the project-plan.md, treating each major phase as a separate PRD document.

## Phase-Based PRD Structure

The project-plan.md contains 6 distinct phases that should be converted into individual PRDs:

### 1. **PRD-1: Environment Setup and Infrastructure**
- **Scope**: Phase 1 environment initialization
- **Key Components**: Directory structure, environment variables, logging setup
- **Deliverables**: Working .taskmaster directory structure, configured environment variables, operational logging system

### 2. **PRD-2: Recursive PRD Generation System**
- **Scope**: Phase 2 recursive decomposition functionality
- **Key Components**: First-level PRD generation, recursive decomposition function, directory structure management
- **Deliverables**: Functional recursive PRD processor, hierarchical directory structure, atomic task identification

### 3. **PRD-3: Computational Optimization Engine**
- **Scope**: Phase 3 optimization algorithms
- **Key Components**: Dependency analysis, square-root space optimization, pebbling strategy, catalytic execution planning
- **Deliverables**: Optimized task execution plans, memory-efficient algorithms, resource allocation strategies

### 4. **PRD-4: Evolutionary Optimization Loop**
- **Scope**: Phase 4 iterative improvement system
- **Key Components**: Autonomous execution capability, evolutionary algorithms, convergence monitoring
- **Deliverables**: Self-improving execution system, autonomy score tracking, optimized execution plans

### 5. **PRD-5: Validation and Queue Management**
- **Scope**: Phase 5 final validation and task queue generation
- **Key Components**: Comprehensive validation, task queue generation, metadata management
- **Deliverables**: Validated execution plans, formatted task queues, comprehensive validation reports

### 6. **PRD-6: Execution Monitoring and Control**
- **Scope**: Phase 6 monitoring and execution management
- **Key Components**: Real-time monitoring, checkpoint/resume functionality, error recovery
- **Deliverables**: Monitoring dashboard, execution control system, recovery mechanisms

## Implementation Strategy

### Automated Generation Process

Since Task 2 is already completed, you can leverage the existing task-master research functionality to generate these PRDs:

```bash
# Generate phase-specific PRDs
task-master research \
    --input project-plan.md \
    --output-pattern "$TASKMASTER_DOCS/phase-{n}-prd.md" \
    --section-based \
    --log-level info
```

### PRD Template Structure

Each generated PRD should follow this structure:

**Header Section**:
- Phase identifier and title
- Dependencies on other phases
- Success criteria specific to the phase

**Requirements Section**:
- Functional requirements
- Technical specifications
- Performance criteria

**Implementation Details**:
- Algorithm specifications
- Code examples from the project plan
- Configuration requirements

**Testing Strategy**:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for phase interactions
- Performance benchmarks

**Deliverables**:
- Expected outputs
- File locations
- Validation criteria

## Leveraging Existing Task Context

Based on your completed tasks, you can enhance the PRD generation with:

1. **Task 3's Recursive System**: Use the existing recursive decomposition function as a template for PRD generation
2. **Task 5's Optimization**: Apply the square-root space optimization principles to PRD processing
3. **Task 7's Pebbling Strategy**: Implement resource allocation timing for PRD generation tasks

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Extract Phase Boundaries**: Parse the project-plan.md to identify clear phase separations
2. **Generate Individual PRDs**: Use the task-master research command with phase-specific parameters
3. **Apply Recursive Decomposition**: Use Task 3's implementation to further break down complex phases
4. **Validate PRD Completeness**: Ensure each PRD can be executed independently while maintaining phase dependencies

This approach transforms the monolithic project plan into manageable, executable PRD documents that align with the task-master recursive system architecture already implemented in your completed tasks.
