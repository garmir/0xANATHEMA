# Environment & Infrastructure PRD

## Overview
Foundation setup and workspace management for the task-master recursive generation system.

## Objectives
- Initialize complete directory structure for system operation
- Configure environment variables for autonomous execution
- Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Set up TouchID sudo configuration for seamless automation
- Establish error recovery and checkpoint mechanisms

## Requirements

### Directory Structure
```
.taskmaster/
├── docs/              # PRD and documentation storage
├── optimization/      # Computational optimization artifacts
├── catalytic/         # Catalytic workspace for memory reuse
└── logs/             # Timestamped execution logs
```

### Environment Variables
- `TASKMASTER_HOME`: Points to `.taskmaster` directory
- `TASKMASTER_DOCS`: Points to docs subdirectory
- `TASKMASTER_LOGS`: Points to logs subdirectory

### Logging System
- Redirect stdout/stderr to timestamped log files
- Use `tee` command for real-time monitoring
- Maintain log rotation for long-running operations

### Sudo Configuration
- Configure TouchID for passwordless sudo operations
- Implement `sudo_with_touchid()` wrapper function
- Ensure security compliance for autonomous execution

### Error Recovery
- Checkpoint functionality for state preservation
- Resume capability from last successful checkpoint
- Graceful handling of system interruptions

## Success Criteria
- All directories created with proper permissions
- Environment variables accessible across sessions
- Logging captures all operation output
- TouchID sudo works without user interaction
- Checkpoint/resume cycle completes successfully

## Dependencies
- macOS with TouchID configured
- Bash shell environment
- Write permissions in working directory

## Acceptance Tests
1. Directory structure matches specification
2. Environment variables persist across shell sessions
3. Log files capture all output with timestamps
4. TouchID sudo executes without prompts
5. Checkpoint files save and restore system state
