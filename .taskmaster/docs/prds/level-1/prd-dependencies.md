# Dependency Analysis & Graph Construction PRD

## Overview
Task relationship mapping and validation system that builds complete dependency graphs from recursive PRD hierarchies.

## Objectives
- Construct complete dependency graphs from all generated PRDs
- Implement cycle detection and resolution algorithms
- Analyze resource requirements and allocation constraints
- Generate task-tree.json with comprehensive metadata
- Provide dependency validation and conflict resolution

## Requirements

### Dependency Graph Construction
- Parse all PRD files in the docs directory hierarchy
- Extract task dependencies and relationships
- Build directed acyclic graph (DAG) representation
- Include resource requirement annotations

### Cycle Detection
- Implement algorithms to detect circular dependencies
- Provide detailed reports of detected cycles
- Suggest resolution strategies for dependency conflicts
- Log all cycle detection results

### Resource Analysis
- Identify resource requirements for each task
- Detect resource conflicts and bottlenecks
- Calculate optimal resource allocation timing
- Include memory, CPU, and I/O considerations

### Output Format (task-tree.json)
```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "task-1",
      "dependencies": ["task-0"],
      "resources": {
        "memory": "100MB",
        "cpu": "low",
        "io": "moderate"
      },
      "complexity": 5,
      "estimated_duration": "15min"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "total_tasks": 10,
    "cycles_detected": 0,
    "max_depth": 3,
    "created": "2025-07-10T17:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Task-Master Integration
- Use available task-master commands for dependency analysis
- Leverage existing validation functionality
- Extend with custom analysis where needed

### Graph Algorithms
- Implement Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting
- Use depth-first search for cycle detection
- Calculate critical path for scheduling optimization

### Resource Modeling
- Abstract resource types (CPU, memory, network, filesystem)
- Model resource constraints and availability
- Calculate resource utilization over time

### Validation Rules
- Verify all dependencies reference valid tasks
- Check for orphaned tasks without dependencies
- Validate resource requirements are realistic

## Success Criteria
- Complete dependency graph generated from all PRDs
- Cycle detection identifies all circular dependencies
- Resource analysis provides accurate allocation guidance
- task-tree.json format is valid and comprehensive
- Validation catches all dependency issues

## Dependencies
- Recursive PRD decomposition system (prd-decomposition.md)
- Task-master CLI dependency management functions
- JSON processing capabilities

## Acceptance Tests
1. Generate dependency graph from simple PRD hierarchy
2. Detect cycles in intentionally circular dependencies
3. Validate resource requirements are captured correctly
4. Verify task-tree.json format compliance
5. Test dependency validation with various error conditions
6. Confirm topological sort produces valid execution order
