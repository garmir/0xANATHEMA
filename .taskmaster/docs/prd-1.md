## Overview

# Task-Master PRD Recursive Generation and Optimization System

## Overview
A self-executing system that recursively decomposes project plans into PRDs, then optimizes task execution using computational complexity theory for autonomous execution.

## Prerequisites
- macOS with TouchID configured
- task-master CLI installed
- Working directory: current directory
- Initial project plan at: `task-master-instructions.md`

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

```bash
#!/bin/bash

## Requirements

Generated from project plan section: Task-Master PRD Recursive Generation and Optimization System

## Implementation Notes

This PRD was auto-generated from the project plan and may require further decomposition.
