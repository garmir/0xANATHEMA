# Checkpoint and resume functionality

## Overview

# Checkpoint and resume functionality
task-master checkpoint --save
task-master resume --from-last-checkpoint
```

## Theory References Applied

1. **Square-Root Space Simulation** - Reduces memory from O(n) to O(√n)
2. **Tree Evaluation in O(log n · log log n)** - Minimizes evaluation space
3. **Pebbling Strategies** - Optimizes resource allocation timing
4. **Catalytic Computing** - Enables memory reuse without data loss
5. **Evolutionary Algorithms** - Iteratively improves execution efficiency

## Self-Execution Command
