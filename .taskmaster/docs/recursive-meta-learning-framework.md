# Recursive Meta-Learning Framework Design
**Task 50.2: Design Recursive Meta-Learning Framework**

## Overview
This document outlines the design for a recursive meta-learning framework that enables the Task-Master AI system to learn optimal strategies, adapt to new environments, and continuously improve its own learning mechanisms through recursive self-improvement cycles.

## Core Architecture Components

### 1. Meta-Learning Engine

#### Experience Memory System
```python
class ExperienceMemory:
    """Stores and manages learning experiences for meta-learning"""
    def __init__(self):
        self.task_episodes = []      # Individual task execution records
        self.strategy_outcomes = {}  # Strategy effectiveness tracking
        self.pattern_library = {}    # Discovered patterns and their contexts
        self.meta_knowledge = {}     # Higher-level learning insights
```

#### Strategy Learning Module
- **Strategy Discovery**: Automatically identify successful task completion patterns
- **Strategy Validation**: Test strategies across different contexts and environments
- **Strategy Evolution**: Modify and improve existing strategies based on performance feedback
- **Strategy Selection**: Choose optimal strategies for specific task types and contexts

#### Pattern Recognition System
- **Temporal Pattern Detection**: Identify time-based patterns in task execution
- **Contextual Pattern Mining**: Discover environment-specific success patterns
- **Cross-Domain Pattern Transfer**: Apply patterns learned in one domain to another
- **Pattern Hierarchy**: Organize patterns from atomic actions to complex strategies

### 2. Recursive Improvement Engine

#### Self-Reflection Module
```python
class SelfReflectionModule:
    """Analyzes system performance and identifies improvement opportunities"""
    def analyze_performance(self, time_window):
        # Analyze recent performance metrics
        # Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies
        # Generate improvement hypotheses
        # Prioritize improvement opportunities
        pass
```

#### Meta-Strategy Optimization

        ]
```

            patterns = self.pattern_extractor.extract_patterns(
                self.experience_buffer
            )
