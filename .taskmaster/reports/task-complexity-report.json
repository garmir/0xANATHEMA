The breadth and depth of technical domains, coupled with the need for real-time reliability and actionable insights, make this a highly complex undertaking. Industry-standard complexity metrics (e.g., cyclomatic complexity, maintainability index) would rate such a multi-faceted, interconnected system at the high end of the scale due to the number of independent components, integration points, and cognitive load required to design, implement, and maintain it[1][2][3][4]."
