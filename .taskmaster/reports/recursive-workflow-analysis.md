### 7. Identified Bottlenecks and Inefficiencies

#### Process Flow Issues
1. **Sequential Research Calls**: Research is done sequentially rather than in parallel
2. **Context Rebuild**: Context analysis repeats for related tasks
3. **Manual Priority Adjustment**: Priority matrix updates are not automated
4. **Limited Feedback Integration**: Research findings don't automatically update related tasks

#### Resource Utilization Gaps
1. **API Rate Limiting**: Could benefit from request batching and caching
2. **Knowledge Redundancy**: Repeated research on similar topics
3. **Context Overflow**: 9,000+ character limit may truncate important context
4. **Single-Model Dependency**: Relies heavily on Perplexity for research

#### Integration Challenges
1. **Workflow Fragmentation**: Research, planning, and execution are separate processes
2. **Knowledge Silos**: Research findings not shared across related tasks
3. **Manual Intervention Points**: Some transitions require human oversight
4. **Scalability Concerns**: Process efficiency may degrade with large task sets

### 8. Recursive Elements Analysis

1. **Task Decomposition**: Recursive breakdown until atomic tasks are reached
2. **Research Loops**: Research calls trigger additional research based on findings
3. **Optimization Cycles**: Evolutionary algorithms with recursive improvement
