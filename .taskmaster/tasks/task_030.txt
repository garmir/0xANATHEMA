# Task ID: 30
# Title: Create Performance Benchmarking Framework
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 28, 29
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop comprehensive benchmarking system for complexity analysis and optimization validation
# Details:
Create benchmarking framework that measures actual vs theoretical complexity bounds. Implement performance profiling for task sets of 100, 1000, and 10000 tasks. Include memory pressure testing, execution time measurement, and optimization effectiveness analysis. Generate detailed reports with statistical analysis and performance recommendations.

# Test Strategy:
Validate benchmark accuracy with known datasets, test performance under various system loads, and verify statistical significance of measurements
