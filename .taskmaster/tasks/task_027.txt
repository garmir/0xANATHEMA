# Task ID: 27
# Title: Develop Comprehensive Execution Roadmap with Validation and Deployment Strategy
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create detailed execution roadmap combining completed Task-Master components into cohesive deployment strategy with validation checkpoints and success criteria.
# Details:
Build comprehensive execution roadmap that integrates all completed Task-Master components: recursive PRD generation, dependency analysis, optimization algorithms, catalytic execution planning, and monitoring systems. Create phased deployment strategy with pre-deployment validation, staged rollout, and post-deployment verification. Implement validation pipeline that verifies system integrity, dependency resolution, resource allocation, and autonomous execution capabilities. Define success criteria for each phase including autonomy score thresholds, performance benchmarks, and reliability metrics. Create rollback procedures and contingency plans for each deployment phase. Generate deployment artifacts including configuration files, environment setup scripts, and operational runbooks. Establish monitoring and alerting for deployment health, execution progress, and system performance metrics.

# Test Strategy:
Verify execution roadmap covers all system components, validation pipeline catches integration issues, deployment phases have clear success criteria and rollback procedures, monitoring captures critical metrics, and end-to-end testing demonstrates autonomous execution capability with target performance and reliability benchmarks.
