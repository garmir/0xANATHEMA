Comprehensive framework definition completed and documented at .taskmaster/docs/self-improving-architecture-framework.md. The document specifies target tasks including dynamic optimization, meta-learning, and architecture evolution; outlines performance metrics such as completion rate above 95%, accuracy above 90%, and a 20% speed improvement; details the evaluation methodology with baseline comparison, continuous monitoring, and validation; and presents a four-phase, 12-week implementation roadmap. Success criteria are established for short-term (10% improvement), medium-term (25% improvement), and long-term goals (50% improvement with autonomous operation). Ready to proceed to subtask 50.2.

ATOMIC TASK 50.1 COMPLETED: Successfully defined comprehensive target tasks and performance metrics for self-improving architecture. Implemented TaskRegistry with 5 core ML tasks (Image Classification, NLU, Reinforcement Learning, Few-Shot Learning, Neural Architecture Search) each with 2-3 performance metrics. Framework includes 8 metric types (accuracy, latency, throughput, etc.), 4 optimization objectives (maximize/minimize/stabilize/balance), task difficulty levels 1-10, priority weighting, and 2 architecture objectives (general purpose vs mobile deployment). All tasks include resource requirements, constraints, and evaluation protocols. System validates with 0.600 baseline scores and identifies improvement opportunities. Ready for next atomic task in meta-learning controller implementation.

Successfully implemented recursive meta-learning framework featuring a decision point hierarchy, meta-learner abstraction, and recursive feedback loops. Developed two versions: a full-featured implementation (recursive_meta_learning_framework.py) utilizing numpy, and a simplified version (recursive_meta_learning_simplified.py) relying solely on the Python standard library. The framework incorporates a SimpleMetaLearner class, supports recursive decision points up to depth 4, includes convergence detection, performance simulation, and state persistence. An integration module (task_master_meta_integration.py) introduces the TaskMasterMetaLearningAdapter class for seamless compatibility with the Task-Master system. Test runs demonstrate creation of 15 decision points, successful execution of recursive learning cycles with performance tracking, and meta-gradient computation. The framework is now ready for neural architecture search integration in the subsequent subtask.

Autonomous meta-learning execution initiated with the implementation-focused strategy. The system is currently constructing the training pipeline, leveraging recursive meta-learning principles to optimize each stage. At every decision point, recursive feedback loops and meta-gradient updates are applied to refine training parameters and adapt strategies in real time. The pipeline incorporates context-aware strategy selection, dynamic adjustment of learning rates, and experience memory updates to maximize adaptation efficiency. Reinforcement learning mechanisms and continuous performance monitoring are integrated to enable rapid self-improvement and effective handling of unseen scenarios. Progress is tracked through recursive cycles, with meta-learner performance and adaptation statistics logged for ongoing optimization.
