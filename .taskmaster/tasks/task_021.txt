# Task ID: 21
# Title: Implement missing recursive PRD processing function (process_prd_recursive) with proper depth tracking
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the process_prd_recursive function with depth tracking (max 5 levels), atomicity checking, and nested directory structure validation as required by task-master-instructions.md
# Details:
Successfully implemented enhanced process_prd_recursive function with comprehensive features: 1) Proper depth tracking with max 5 levels and specific error codes for depth violations, 2) Advanced atomicity checking using content analysis with atomic vs composite indicators to determine if PRDs need further decomposition, 3) Directory structure validation with naming convention enforcement to ensure proper subdirectory creation follows expected hierarchy, 4) Enhanced error handling for file formats, filesystem operations, and depth limits with appropriate error messages, 5) Comprehensive status reporting with JSON metadata output for debugging and monitoring. The function handles recursive calls by incrementing depth counter, validates directory structure at each level, and returns proper status codes for success/failure conditions. Function has been tested successfully and correctly identifies atomic/composite PRDs.

# Test Strategy:
Function has been successfully tested with sample PRDs at different depths, max depth limit of 5 is properly enforced with specific error codes, atomicity checking correctly identifies atomic vs decomposable tasks using content analysis, nested directory structure creation matches expected hierarchy with naming convention enforcement, error handling works correctly for invalid inputs and edge cases, function returns appropriate status codes and error messages with JSON metadata output
