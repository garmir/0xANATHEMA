# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Evolutionary Optimization Loop
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 17
# Priority: high
# Description: Create iterative improvement system using evolutionary algorithms to achieve autonomous execution
# Details:
Implement optimize_to_autonomous function with 20 max iterations and 0.95 convergence threshold. Include evaluation metrics (time, space, autonomy), evolutionary improvements with mutation rate 0.1 and crossover rate 0.7. Apply exponential-evolutionary theory for continuous improvement until autonomous execution capability is achieved.

# Test Strategy:
Test convergence to autonomy score â‰¥ 0.95, verify evolutionary improvements show measurable progress, and confirm final execution plan meets all autonomy criteria.
