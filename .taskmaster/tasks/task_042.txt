# Task ID: 42
# Title: Resolve Python Package Import Issues
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Diagnose and fix Python package import problems in the Task Master AI system by identifying missing dependencies and configuration issues.
# Details:
Analyze the current Python environment to identify missing packages, version conflicts, or path issues preventing proper imports. Check requirements.txt, setup.py, or pyproject.toml files for missing dependencies. Verify virtual environment is properly activated and contains required packages. Use pip list to audit installed packages and pip install to resolve missing dependencies. Check PYTHONPATH configuration and module structure. If using conda, verify environment is activated and packages are available. Document the resolution steps and update project configuration files to prevent future import issues.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all required packages can be imported without errors using python -c 'import package_name' for each dependency. Run the main application or test suite to confirm functionality is restored. Check that requirements.txt or equivalent dependency files are updated with correct versions. Test in a clean virtual environment to ensure reproducibility. Validate that the fix works across different Python versions if applicable.
