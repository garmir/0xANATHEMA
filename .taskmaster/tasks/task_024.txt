# Task ID: 24
# Title: Validate and Fix File Structure Conformance
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Comprehensive validation and correction of file structure conformance including environment variables, catalytic workspace, logging setup, and TouchID sudo configuration according to task-master-instructions.md requirements
# Details:
1. Validate TASKMASTER_HOME, TASKMASTER_DOCS, TASKMASTER_LOGS environment variables are correctly set and accessible. 2. Verify catalytic workspace is properly initialized with 10GB capacity and accessible permissions. 3. Audit comprehensive logging setup ensuring all output is captured with proper timestamping and rotation. 4. Configure TouchID sudo authentication for seamless autonomous execution without password prompts. 5. Cross-reference all configurations against task-master-instructions.md requirements. 6. Generate compliance report identifying any deviations and auto-fix where possible. 7. Update file permissions and ownership as needed for proper system operation. 8. Validate directory structure matches expected hierarchy with proper nested organization.

# Test Strategy:
1. Execute environment variable validation script to confirm all TASKMASTER_* variables are set correctly. 2. Test catalytic workspace accessibility and verify 10GB capacity allocation. 3. Validate logging system captures output to expected locations with proper timestamps. 4. Test TouchID sudo configuration by attempting privileged operations without password prompts. 5. Run compliance checker against task-master-instructions.md to verify 100% conformance. 6. Execute file permission validation to ensure all directories and files have correct access controls. 7. Perform end-to-end system test to verify all components work together seamlessly.
