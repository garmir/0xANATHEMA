# Task ID: 28
# Title: Implement TaskComplexityAnalyzer Core Engine
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core complexity analysis engine with mathematical optimization algorithms
# Details:
Implement TaskComplexityAnalyzer class in Python 3.8+ with support for greedy, dynamic programming, and adaptive optimization strategies. Include complexity calculation methods for O(√n) and O(log n · log log n) bounds. Create base classes for optimization strategies and implement mathematical models for task dependency analysis. Include memory profiling capabilities and adaptive scheduling algorithms.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for each optimization strategy, complexity bound validation with synthetic datasets, memory usage profiling, and performance benchmarking with 100/1000/10000 task scenarios
