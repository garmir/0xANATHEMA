# Task ID: 41
# Title: Create Autonomous Research-Driven Workflow Loop
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a self-improving workflow system that uses task-master with Perplexity research to overcome blockers and executes solutions by parsing todo steps back into Claude until success
# Details:
Create an autonomous loop that monitors task execution for blockers, triggers Perplexity research when stuck, generates solution todo lists, and feeds them back to Claude Code for execution. The system should include: 1) Task execution monitoring with failure detection, 2) Perplexity API integration for research-driven problem solving, 3) Todo list generation from research findings, 4) Claude Code API integration for automated execution, 5) Success validation and loop continuation logic, 6) Exponential backoff for failed attempts, 7) Context preservation across iterations, 8) Integration with existing catalytic execution planning and monitoring systems. The loop should leverage the evolutionary optimization framework and validation systems already implemented.

# Test Strategy:
Verify the workflow loop can detect task execution failures, successfully trigger Perplexity research, generate actionable todo lists, execute them via Claude Code, validate success, and continue autonomously. Test with intentionally failing tasks to ensure research and recovery mechanisms work. Verify integration with existing monitoring dashboard and checkpoint/resume functionality.
