# Task ID: 29
# Title: Implement Recursive PRD Generation System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 28
# Priority: high
# Description: Create recursive PRD decomposition system with depth tracking and atomic task detection
# Details:
Build recursive PRD processor with configurable depth limits (max 5 levels). Implement atomic task detection using complexity analysis. Create PRD decomposition functions that generate sub-PRDs and manage directory structure. Include depth tracking, memory management, and convergence detection. Integrate with existing task-master CLI for seamless operation.

# Test Strategy:
Test with complex project PRDs, validate depth limiting, verify atomic task detection accuracy, and test memory usage during deep recursion scenarios
