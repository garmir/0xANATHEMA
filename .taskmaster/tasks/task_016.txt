# Task ID: 16
# Title: Generate Pebbling Strategy for Resource Allocation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 15
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create pebbling strategy using branching program approach to minimize memory usage
# Details:
Implement task-master pebble with branching-program strategy. Generate pebbling-strategy.json that optimizes resource allocation timing. Focus on memory minimization while maintaining execution correctness. Include resource contention resolution and timing optimization.

# Test Strategy:
Validate pebbling strategy produces valid resource allocation plan, verify memory minimization objectives are met, and confirm timing constraints are respected.
