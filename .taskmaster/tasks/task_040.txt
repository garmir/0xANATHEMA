# Task ID: 40
# Title: Create comprehensive system integration and deployment verification framework
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop end-to-end testing framework that validates all Task Master components work together seamlessly, including recursive PRD processing, optimization algorithms, intelligent task prediction, and autonomous execution capabilities.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive integration testing suite that validates the complete Task Master workflow from initial PRD input through autonomous execution. Create test scenarios for: (1) End-to-end recursive PRD decomposition with depth validation and atomicity checks, (2) Optimization pipeline validation including sqrt-decomposition, tree evaluation, and pebbling strategies, (3) Catalytic execution planning with memory reuse verification, (4) Evolutionary optimization loop convergence testing, (5) Final validation and monitoring system functionality, (6) Cross-component integration with data flow validation, (7) Performance benchmarking under various load conditions, (8) Failure recovery and checkpoint/resume functionality, (9) Resource allocation and deallocation timing verification, (10) Autonomous execution capability assessment with human intervention metrics. Implement automated test harness with configurable test suites, detailed reporting, and CI/CD integration capabilities.

# Test Strategy:
Execute comprehensive test suite covering: full workflow integration tests from PRD input to autonomous execution, component isolation tests to verify individual modules, performance benchmarks measuring execution time and memory usage, stress tests with large PRD files and complex task hierarchies, failure injection tests to validate error handling and recovery, checkpoint/resume functionality under various failure scenarios, resource allocation timing verification, autonomy score calculation accuracy, and regression testing against known good baselines. Verify all tests pass with 100% success rate and performance metrics meet specified thresholds.
