## 1. Analyze and Document Current Dependency Graph Generation Logic [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review the existing implementation of dependency graph generation to understand its structure, recursive steps, and current limitations. Document the flow and identify areas that require refactoring for atomicity and improved debugging.
### Details:
This step involves code analysis, reviewing documentation, and mapping out the current recursive logic and cycle handling.

Completed comprehensive analysis of current dependency graph generation logic. Analyzed optimization_engine.py implementation revealing: 1) Simple linear dependency building without cycle detection, 2) Three optimization strategies (greedy, critical path, adaptive) with varying dependency handling, 3) Major gaps in cycle detection and error reporting, 4) Scalability issues with O(n²) algorithms, 5) Limited debugging capabilities. Created detailed analysis document with technical debt assessment and refactoring recommendations. Ready to proceed with atomic recursive steps design.

Comprehensive analysis of current dependency graph generation completed and documented at .taskmaster/docs/atomic-dependency-graph-refactor.md. Reviewed GitHub Actions workflows (recursive-improvement-pipeline.yml) and identified key improvement areas: monolithic functions with multiple responsibilities, limited cycle detection and profiling, minimal debugging support, performance and scalability concerns with large graphs. The current implementation relies on basic topological sort using defaultdict structures. Prepared to move forward with atomic recursive refactoring implementation.

ANALYSIS COMPLETE: Documented comprehensive dependency graph generation logic across multiple files:

Core Findings:
- Multiple implementation approaches identified: simple adjacency lists in optimization_engine.py and advanced NetworkX integration in graph_orchestration.py
- Fragmented architecture with three main implementations, each offering different capabilities
- Critical issues found: silent cycle detection failures, O(n²) performance bottlenecks, and lack of visualization tools
- Advanced features present in some modules, including multi-agent orchestration, fault tolerance, and parallel execution planning

Key Files Analyzed:
- Core dependency analysis with performance issues
- Advanced NetworkX-based implementation
- Complete integration system
- Existing analysis documentation

Implementation Details:
- Data structures: comparison between adjacency lists and NetworkX DiGraphs
- Functions reviewed: analyze_dependencies(), find_cycles(), validate_graph(), get_execution_order()
- Integration points: Task Master AI, multi-agent systems, resource management

Recommendations:
- Unify graph implementations using NetworkX as the standard
- Add robust cycle detection to the optimization engine
- Implement graph visualization capabilities
- Optimize performance for large-scale operations
- Enhance debugging and error reporting

Analysis complete and ready to proceed to the atomic recursive refactoring design phase.

## 2. Design Atomic Recursive Steps for Dependency Graph Generation [done]
### Dependencies: 52.1
### Description: Refactor the dependency graph generation process into clearly defined atomic recursive steps, ensuring each step performs a single, well-defined operation.
### Details:
Break down the recursive logic so that each function or method is responsible for a single aspect of graph generation, such as node discovery, edge creation, or cycle detection.

## 3. Implement Cycle Profiling Mechanism [done]
### Dependencies: 52.2
### Description: Integrate a profiling mechanism to detect, record, and analyze cycles within the dependency graph during generation.
### Details:
Develop logic to identify cycles as the graph is built, collect relevant metrics (e.g., cycle length, involved nodes), and store profiling data for debugging and optimization.

## 4. Enhance Debugging Capabilities for Recursive Steps [done]
### Dependencies: 52.3
### Description: Add detailed debugging output and logging to each atomic recursive step, including cycle detection and profiling, to facilitate troubleshooting and analysis.
### Details:
Implement structured logging and, where appropriate, visualization hooks to trace the execution flow and data transformations at each step.

## 5. Validate and Test Refactored Dependency Graph Generation [done]
### Dependencies: 52.4
### Description: Perform comprehensive testing of the refactored dependency graph generation, including atomicity, cycle profiling, and debugging features, to ensure correctness and robustness.
### Details:
Use a combination of unit, integration, and system tests with diverse project structures (including cyclic and acyclic graphs) to validate the new implementation.

## 6. Analyze and Document Current Dependency Graph Generation Logic [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review the existing implementation of dependency graph generation to understand its structure, recursive steps, and current limitations. Document the flow and identify areas that require refactoring for atomicity, cycle profiling, and debugging.
### Details:
This step involves a thorough code review and documentation of the current logic, focusing on how dependencies are identified and processed recursively.

## 7. Design Atomic Recursive Steps for Dependency Graph Generation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Refactor the dependency graph generation process into clearly defined atomic recursive steps, ensuring each step performs a single, well-defined operation.
### Details:
Break down the recursive logic so that each function or method handles only one aspect of the graph generation, such as node discovery, edge creation, or dependency resolution.

## 8. Implement Cycle Detection and Profiling Mechanism [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate cycle detection within the recursive steps and add profiling to capture cycle-related metrics during graph generation.
### Details:
Use established algorithms (e.g., depth-first search with backtracking) to detect cycles and collect data such as cycle length, frequency, and affected nodes.

## 9. Enhance Debugging Capabilities for Recursive Graph Generation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add detailed logging and debugging hooks to each atomic recursive step, enabling easier tracing of graph generation and cycle detection processes.
### Details:
Implement structured logs and optional debug modes that output step-by-step execution details, including recursion depth and detected cycles.

## 10. Validate and Optimize Refactored Dependency Graph Generation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Test the refactored implementation for correctness, performance, and maintainability. Optimize recursive steps and cycle profiling as needed based on test results.
### Details:
Run comprehensive integration tests, profile performance, and refactor code for efficiency and clarity. Solicit feedback from team members and iterate as necessary.
