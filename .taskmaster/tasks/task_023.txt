# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement Autonomous Execution Validation System with Evolutionary Optimization
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create comprehensive autonomous execution validation system with 95% autonomy scoring, evolutionary algorithm optimization, checkpoint/resume functionality, and real-time monitoring dashboard
# Details:
Build autonomous execution validation system with multiple components: 1) Autonomy scoring engine that evaluates task execution capability and targets 95% autonomous execution score, 2) Evolutionary algorithm implementation with 20 iterations maximum, mutation rate 0.1, crossover rate 0.7, and convergence threshold 0.95, 3) Checkpoint/resume functionality with 5-minute intervals and state persistence, 4) Real-time monitoring dashboard showing execution progress, autonomy scores, evolutionary improvements, and system health metrics. The system should integrate with existing task execution pipeline, validate against task-master-instructions.md specifications, and provide failsafe mechanisms for non-autonomous tasks. Implement exponential-evolutionary theory for continuous improvement and ensure backward compatibility with existing task execution workflows.

# Test Strategy:
Verify autonomy scoring accurately measures execution capability and achieves target 95% score, evolutionary algorithm converges within 20 iterations and improves task execution autonomy, checkpoint/resume functionality preserves state correctly and recovers from interruptions, real-time dashboard displays accurate metrics and updates in real-time, system integration works seamlessly with existing task execution pipeline, and validation against task-master-instructions.md specifications passes all requirements
