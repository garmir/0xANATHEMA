# Task ID: 31
# Title: Implement Catalytic Workspace System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 28
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create catalytic computing workspace with memory reuse and checkpoint capabilities
# Details:
Implement catalytic workspace that enables memory reuse without data loss. Create checkpoint/resume functionality with state persistence. Include workspace isolation, memory management, and data integrity verification. Integrate with existing task execution pipeline and provide rollback capabilities for failed operations.

# Test Strategy:
Test memory reuse efficiency, validate checkpoint/resume under various failure scenarios, and verify data integrity throughout execution cycles
