# Task ID: 14
# Title: Build Dependency Analysis and Task Graph
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Analyze task dependencies and create complete dependency graph with cycle detection
# Details:
Use task-master analyze-dependencies to process all PRDs in the docs directory. Generate task-tree.json with complete dependency mapping, resource requirements, and cycle detection. Include comprehensive analysis of inter-task relationships and resource conflicts.

# Test Strategy:
Verify task-tree.json contains all tasks with correct dependencies, confirm cycle detection identifies any circular dependencies, and validate resource requirements are properly captured.
