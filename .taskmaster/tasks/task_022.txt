# Task ID: 22
# Title: Implement Space Complexity Measurement and Validation System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create comprehensive measurement and validation system to verify O(√n) memory optimization and O(log n · log log n) tree evaluation complexity, including benchmarking tools and performance profiling capabilities.
# Details:
Implement space complexity measurement framework with memory tracking APIs to monitor actual memory usage during task execution. Create validation system to verify theoretical O(√n) bounds from sqrt-space algorithm and O(log n · log log n) bounds from tree evaluation optimization. Build benchmarking suite with configurable test datasets of varying sizes (n = 100, 1000, 10000, 100000) to measure actual vs theoretical complexity. Implement performance profiling tools including memory usage graphs, execution time analysis, and complexity curve fitting. Create automated test harness that validates optimizations against mathematical bounds with 95% confidence intervals. Include regression detection to ensure optimizations don't degrade over time. Generate detailed performance reports with visual complexity charts and statistical analysis.

# Test Strategy:
Verify memory tracking accurately measures heap usage during task execution, validation system correctly identifies when actual complexity exceeds theoretical bounds, benchmarking suite produces consistent results across multiple runs, and performance profiling generates accurate complexity curves. Test with edge cases including minimum dataset (n=1) and maximum practical dataset sizes. Validate that O(√n) measurements stay within 10% of theoretical bounds and O(log n · log log n) measurements stay within 15% of theoretical bounds. Ensure regression detection catches performance degradation of 5% or more.
