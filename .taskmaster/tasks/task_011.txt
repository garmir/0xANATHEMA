# Task ID: 11
# Title: Initialize Environment and Directory Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the complete working environment with proper directory structure and environment variables
# Details:
Create .taskmaster directory with subdirectories (docs, optimization, catalytic, logs). Set environment variables TASKMASTER_HOME, TASKMASTER_DOCS, TASKMASTER_LOGS. Enable comprehensive logging with tee command to capture all stdout/stderr to timestamped log files. Ensure proper permissions and directory ownership.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all directories exist, environment variables are set correctly, and logging captures both stdout and stderr to the expected log file location.
