# Task ID: 17
# Title: Initialize Catalytic Workspace and Execution Planning
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Set up catalytic computing workspace and generate execution plan with memory reuse
# Details:
Initialize 10GB catalytic workspace using task-master catalytic-init. Generate catalytic execution plan with 0.8 reuse factor for memory efficiency. Implement memory reuse strategies without data loss. Create catalytic-execution.json with optimized resource utilization patterns.

# Test Strategy:
Verify catalytic workspace is properly initialized with correct size, confirm execution plan achieves target reuse factor, and validate memory reuse strategies maintain data integrity.
