# Task ID: 26
# Title: Implement Advanced Task Complexity Analysis and Optimization Engine
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create sophisticated task complexity analysis system that evaluates computational requirements and optimizes task execution order based on resource constraints and algorithmic efficiency.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive complexity analysis engine that extends beyond basic dependency mapping to analyze computational complexity of each task. Create TaskComplexityAnalyzer class that evaluates time complexity O(n), space complexity O(n), I/O requirements, and parallelization potential for each atomic task. Build OptimizationEngine that uses complexity metrics to reorder tasks for maximum efficiency, considering CPU cores, memory limits, and I/O bandwidth. Implement adaptive scheduling that adjusts task priorities based on real-time system resource availability. Create complexity reporting dashboard that visualizes bottlenecks and optimization opportunities. Support multiple optimization strategies: greedy scheduling, dynamic programming approach, and machine learning-based prediction. Generate optimized execution plans that minimize total execution time while respecting resource constraints.

# Test Strategy:
Test complexity analysis with tasks of known computational requirements, verify O(n) calculations are accurate within 10% margin. Test optimization engine with constrained resources (2GB RAM, 2 CPU cores) and verify tasks are properly reordered to prevent resource exhaustion. Create synthetic task sets with known optimal solutions and verify engine finds solutions within 95% of optimal. Test adaptive scheduling by simulating resource changes during execution and verifying task priorities adjust appropriately. Validate complexity reporting dashboard displays accurate metrics and bottleneck identification. Performance test with 1000+ atomic tasks to ensure analysis completes within 30 seconds.
