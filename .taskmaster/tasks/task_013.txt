# Task ID: 13
# Title: Develop Recursive PRD Decomposition System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the recursive function that processes PRDs and generates sub-PRDs with depth tracking
# Details:
Implement process_prd_recursive function with depth tracking (max depth 5), atomic task detection, and proper directory creation. Include checks for atomicity using task-master next --check-atomic. Create nested directory structure matching PRD hierarchy. Handle edge cases like max depth reached and file existence checks.

# Test Strategy:
Test recursive processing with various PRD complexities, verify max depth enforcement, confirm atomic task detection works correctly, and validate the nested directory structure matches expected format.
