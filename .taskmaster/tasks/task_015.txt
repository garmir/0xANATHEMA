# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Space-Efficient Optimization Algorithms
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Apply square-root space simulation and tree evaluation optimization to reduce memory complexity
# Details:
Implement sqrt-space algorithm to reduce memory from O(n) to O(âˆšn) using Williams 2025 approach. Apply tree evaluation optimization with O(log n * log log n) space complexity. Chain optimizations: sqrt-optimized.json -> tree-optimized.json. Include memory bound validation and complexity verification.

# Test Strategy:
Measure memory usage before and after optimization, verify space complexity improvements, and confirm optimization chain produces valid output files with maintained functionality.
