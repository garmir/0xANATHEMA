# Task ID: 39
# Title: Implement intelligent task prediction and auto-generation system
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create an AI-powered system that analyzes project patterns, development trajectory, and user behavior to automatically predict and generate future tasks based on historical data and project evolution patterns.
# Details:
Build a comprehensive prediction engine with the following components: 1) Pattern Analysis Module - analyze completed tasks, code changes, and user interactions to identify recurring patterns and workflows; 2) Trajectory Prediction Engine - use machine learning models (time series analysis, neural networks) to predict development direction based on project history; 3) Behavioral Learning System - track user preferences, coding patterns, and task completion sequences to personalize predictions; 4) Auto-Generation Framework - create tasks automatically based on predictions with confidence scores and human approval workflows; 5) Feedback Loop - continuously improve predictions based on user acceptance/rejection of generated tasks; 6) Integration Layer - seamlessly integrate with existing task-master commands and workflows. Implement using Python with scikit-learn for ML models, utilize task-master's existing JSON structure for data persistence, and create REST API endpoints for real-time predictions.

# Test Strategy:
Test pattern recognition accuracy with historical project data, verify prediction confidence scores are calibrated correctly, validate auto-generated tasks follow proper task-master format and dependencies, test behavioral learning improves predictions over time, ensure integration doesn't break existing workflows, verify API endpoints respond correctly, and test system performance with large datasets
