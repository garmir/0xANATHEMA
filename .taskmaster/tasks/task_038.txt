# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a comprehensive system optimization and monitoring suite that uses AI-powered performance analysis and autonomous self-healing capabilities to maintain optimal system performance.
# Details:
Implement a multi-layered system optimization suite with the following components: 1) Real-time performance monitoring dashboard with metrics collection for CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network usage, 2) AI-powered performance analysis engine using machine learning algorithms to identify bottlenecks and predict performance degradation, 3) Autonomous self-healing system that can automatically apply optimizations, restart failed services, and redistribute workloads, 4) Integration with existing catalytic execution planning to leverage memory reuse capabilities, 5) Advanced anomaly detection using statistical analysis and pattern recognition, 6) Automated performance tuning with A/B testing for optimization strategies, 7) Comprehensive logging and alerting system with configurable thresholds, 8) API endpoints for external monitoring tools integration, 9) Historical performance data analysis and trending, 10) Self-diagnostic capabilities that can identify and resolve common system issues autonomously.

# Test Strategy:
Verify monitoring dashboard displays real-time metrics accurately, AI analysis engine correctly identifies performance bottlenecks in test scenarios, autonomous self-healing system successfully resolves simulated failures without human intervention, integration with catalytic execution planning maintains 0.8 reuse factor, anomaly detection identifies outliers with 95% accuracy, automated tuning improves performance metrics by at least 15%, logging captures all system events with proper categorization, API endpoints respond correctly to monitoring tool requests, historical analysis provides meaningful insights over time, and self-diagnostic system resolves at least 80% of common issues automatically.
