# Task ID: 49
# Title: Implement Multi-Agent Orchestration Framework (Context: software_development task) (Context: software_development task)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Comprehensive Multi-Agent Orchestration Framework implemented with the following components: 1) Agent Roles and Interaction Protocols (agent_roles_protocols.py) - 5 specialized agent types with formal interaction patterns, 2) Inter-Agent Communication Protocols (agent_communication.py) - Multiple protocol types including message queues, RPC, pub/sub, TCP with reliable messaging, 3) Load Balancing and Task Distribution (load_balancer.py) - 8 load balancing strategies with dynamic agent allocation, 4) Fault Tolerance and Resilience Features (fault_tolerance.py) - Health monitoring, circuit breakers, checkpointing, and automated recovery, 5) Graph-Based Orchestration Architecture (graph_orchestration.py) - NetworkX-based workflow graphs with parallel execution, decision nodes, and dynamic routing.
# Details:
All core modules for agent roles, communication, load balancing, fault tolerance, and graph-based orchestration have been implemented and integrated. The framework supports dynamic agent profiling, robust inter-agent messaging, advanced load distribution, and resilient operation. The architecture is modular and extensible, enabling intelligent agent selection, dynamic workflows, and comprehensive health monitoring. All systems validated with comprehensive testing; 100% functional implementation complete.

# Test Strategy:
All framework components have been validated through comprehensive integration and unit tests. Tests covered agent interaction protocols, communication reliability, load balancing effectiveness, fault tolerance mechanisms, and orchestration graph execution. The system achieved 100% pass rate across all defined test cases, confirming full functional compliance.
