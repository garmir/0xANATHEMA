# Task ID: 33
# Title: Implement Evolutionary Optimization Loop
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 28, 30
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create evolutionary algorithm system for iterative execution plan optimization
# Details:
Implement evolutionary algorithm with mutation and crossover operations for execution plan optimization. Include fitness evaluation, population management, and convergence detection. Create adaptive parameter tuning based on problem complexity. Target 95% autonomy score with configurable convergence thresholds and maximum iteration limits.

# Test Strategy:
Test convergence rates with different parameter settings, validate fitness evaluation accuracy, and measure optimization effectiveness across various problem types
