# LABRYS - Double-Edged AI Development Framework

## Project Overview
**LABRYS** is a dual-aspect AI development framework that embodies the ancient symbol of the double-headed axe - representing both creation and destruction, analysis and synthesis, research and implementation. This project refactors the 0xANATHEMA codebase into a unified, TaskMaster-driven development system.

### Etymology & Symbolism
The **labrys** (λάβρυς) is an ancient double-headed axe symbolizing:
- **Duality**: Both analytical and creative capabilities
- **Balance**: Structured planning with adaptive execution  
- **Power**: Authority over complex development workflows
- **Precision**: Sharp, targeted problem-solving capabilities

## Core Architecture

### 1. Dual-Aspect Processing Engine
**Concept**: Like the labrys's two blades, the system operates on two complementary planes:

#### Left Blade: Analytical Engine
- **Static Analysis**: Code pattern recognition and architectural review
- **Computational Research**: Integration with Perplexity API for real-time knowledge
- **Constraint Identification**: Technical limitation assessment
- **Risk Evaluation**: Security and performance analysis

#### Right Blade: Synthesis Engine  
- **Code Generation**: Claude-SPARC methodology implementation
- **Parallel Execution**: Multi-terminal workflow coordination
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Real-time task modification based on feedback
- **Integration Management**: Component assembly and validation

### 2. TaskMaster Integration Layer
**Foundation**: Enhanced TaskMaster framework with labrys methodology

## Conclusion

**LABRYS** represents the culmination of 0xANATHEMA's multi-paradigm approach, crystallized into a dual-aspect framework that embodies both the analytical precision and creative synthesis necessary for advanced AI development workflows. The system leverages the power of the ancient labrys symbol - two sharp edges working in perfect harmony to achieve precision cuts through complex development challenges.

This framework successfully integrates:
- **TaskMaster** workflow management
- **Perplexity API** research capabilities  
- **Claude-SPARC** development methodology
- **Parallel execution** coordination
- **Computational complexity** optimization

The result is a system that can autonomously plan, research, analyze, and implement sophisticated development projects while maintaining the balance and precision symbolized by the ancient labrys.
