## üìã Operational Recommendations

### Process Management

1. **Monitor CPU Usage**: 100% CPU usage in interactive mode is normal but should be monitored for extended periods

2. **Memory Monitoring**: Current usage (26MB) is efficient; monitor for any growth trends

3. **Process Health**: Long-running process (34+ minutes) shows stability

### Framework Optimization

1. **Interactive Mode**: Consider timeout mechanisms for long-running interactive sessions

2. **Resource Management**: Current resource usage is optimal

3. **Component Lifecycle**: All components properly loaded and operational
