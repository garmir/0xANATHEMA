# Action Plan to Achieve 95% Autonomy Score

## A) Fix tasks.json Validation Issues

The core issue appears to be that the task-master system cannot locate or parse valid tasks in the tasks.json file during optimization. This suggests structural problems with the task database:

**Immediate Actions:**
- **Verify tasks.json exists and is readable** at `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json`
- **Validate JSON structure** using `jq . .taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json` to check for syntax errors
- **Check task schema compliance** - ensure all tasks have required fields (id, title, description, status, priority)
- **Regenerate task files** using `task-master generate` to sync tasks.json with individual task markdown files
- **Test task parsing** with `task-master list` to verify the system can read tasks properly

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The validation failure likely stems from either corrupted JSON, missing required fields, or incorrect task ID formatting. Since Task 4 shows dependency analysis as complete, the issue may have emerged during subsequent optimization steps.

## B) Resolve Dependency Analysis Problems

Dependency analysis errors are preventing the system from building the complete task graph needed for autonomous execution:

**Diagnostic Steps:**
- **Run dependency validation** with `task-master validate-dependencies` to identify specific issues
- **Check for circular dependencies** that would prevent proper task ordering
- **Verify dependency references** - ensure all dependency IDs exist in tasks.json
- **Test task graph generation** to confirm the system can build the complete dependency tree

**Repair Actions:**
- **Fix orphaned dependencies** by removing references to non-existent tasks
- **Resolve circular dependencies** by restructuring task relationships
- **Validate task ID format** - ensure proper hierarchical numbering (1, 1.1, 1.1.1)
- **Regenerate task-tree.json** using `task-master analyze-dependencies` after fixing core issues

## C) Implement Missing Autonomy Components

The 0.65 autonomy score indicates several critical autonomous execution capabilities are missing or non-functional:

**Missing Components to Implement:**
- **Atomic task validation** - system must verify each task is executable without human intervention
- **Resource allocation tracking** - memory, CPU, and time estimates for each task
- **Checkpoint/resume functionality** - ability to pause and restart execution at any point
- **Error handling and recovery** - autonomous response to common failure scenarios
- **Progress monitoring** - real-time tracking of execution status and completion metrics

**Implementation Strategy:**
Based on the completed tasks, the framework exists but needs activation. Focus on enabling the monitoring dashboard from Task 10 and ensuring the catalytic execution planning from Task 8 is properly integrated with the main execution flow.

## D) Address Critical Check Failures

Critical checks are failing because the system cannot verify autonomous execution readiness:

**Critical Checks to Fix:**
- **Task atomicity verification** - each task must be decomposable no further
- **Complete dependency mapping** - all task relationships must be explicit
- **Resource optimization validation** - confirm O(âˆšn) memory usage is achieved
- **Execution plan completeness** - verify every task has clear execution steps
- **Autonomous capability scoring** - implement proper metrics for the 0.95 threshold

**Systematic Approach:**
1. **Rebuild from task-tree.json** - ensure the optimization pipeline from Tasks 4-8 produces valid output
2. **Verify pebbling strategy** - confirm Task 7's pebbling optimization is properly applied
3. **Test evolutionary optimization** - run the iterative improvement loop to identify specific failure points
4. **Enable monitoring dashboard** - activate Task 10's validation system to get detailed failure analysis

## Execution Priority

**Phase 1 (Immediate):** Fix tasks.json validation and dependency analysis
**Phase 2 (Short-term):** Implement missing autonomy components and monitoring
**Phase 3 (Final):** Address critical check failures and achieve 95% autonomy score

The recursive PRD decomposition system (Task 3) and optimization algorithms (Tasks 5-6) appear functional based on their completion status. The issue likely lies in the integration between these components and the final validation system.
