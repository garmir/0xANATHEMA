```

**Task-Specific Attributes:**
```python
TASK_ID = "task.id"                       # Unique task identifier
TASK_TYPE = "task.type"                   # research, optimization, etc.
TASK_STATUS = "task.status"               # pending, running, completed
TASK_PRIORITY = "task.priority"           # high, medium, low
TASK_COMPLEXITY = "task.complexity"       # Complexity score
TASK_DURATION = "task.duration_seconds"   # Execution time
```

**Research-Specific Attributes:**

RESEARCH_RESULTS_COUNT = "research.results.count"
RESEARCH_CONFIDENCE = "research.confidence"
RESEARCH_TOKENS_USED = "research.tokens.used"
```

#### Cross-Signal Correlation

All signals share common correlation context:
```python
@dataclass
class CorrelationContext:
    trace_id: str          # 32-character hex
    span_id: str           # 16-character hex  
    service_name: str
    service_version: str
    service_instance_id: str
    environment: str
    timestamp: str         # ISO 8601 format
```
